Coyotes
Written by Bob McDill (performed by Don Edwards)
Appears on  Grizzly Man soundtrack 2005

As a cowboy I knew in south Texas
His face was burnt deep by the sun
Part history
Part sage
Part Mexican
He was there poncho villa was young
And he'd tell you a tale of the old days
When the country was wild all around
Sit out under the stars of the milky way
And listen while the coyotes howl
They go:
Woo
Yip
Whoo
Yip
Woo

Now the longhorns are gone
And the drovers are gone
The commanchees are gone
And the outlaws are gone
Gernomino's gone
And sandbass is gone
And the lion is gone
And the redwolf is gone

Well he cursed all the roads in the old land
And he cursed the automobile
Said this is no place for an hombre like I am
In this new world of asphalt and steel
Then he'd look off someplace in the distance
At something only he could see
He'd say all that's left now is the old days
Damned old coyotes and me
They'd go:
Woo
Yip
Whoo
Yip
Woo

Now the longhorns are gone
And the drovers are gone
The commanchees are gone
And the outlaws are gone
Now quantro's gone
San wantee is gone
And the lion is gone
And the redwolf is gone

One morning they searched his adobe
He disappeared without even word
But that night as the moon crossed the mountain
One more coyote was heard
And he'd go:
Woo
Yip
Whoo
Yip
Woo
