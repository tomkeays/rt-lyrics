She Said It Was Destiny

Is this the togetherness she meant - so rosy
I thought we'd share a continent - so cosy
I thought love's passions really
Would be more touchy-feely

She said it was Destiny
She said it was written somewhere
But if it was destiny
Why am I over here and she's over there

She said it was in the stars
Something that just had to be
But Venus aligned with Mars
Always really takes it out of me

O I'm not proud of my deceit - you know that
To come so near and then retreat - you know that
One beat before I fell
Somewhere I heard a bell - ring, ring

She said it was Destiny
She said it was written somewhere
But if it was destiny
Why am I over here and she's over there

There's clouds across my crystal ball - too misty
Was I too quick to give it all - when she kissed me
She's thrown a net on me
Razor wire geometry

She said it was Destiny
She said it was written somewhere
But if it was destiny
Why am I over here and she's over there

She said it was in the stars
Something that just had to be
But Venus aligned with Mars
Always really takes it out of me
