Happy Days and Auld Lang Syne
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	The Old Kit Bag   (2003)

He said, Dear, I'm leaving, right there in the hallway
As the party roared on all around
And her head wouldn't turn, O she couldn't look at him
In a whirlpool she quietly drowned
And she said to herself, I won't cry, I won't grieve
But I'll laugh and I'll flow with the wine
With the fast love of strangers we'll sing Sweet Bye and Bye
Happy Days and Auld Lang Syne

How I wish I knew
All the old songs they're singing
Such comfort they're bringing
To a heart that's as empty as mine
O it lifts you so high
Does the Sweet Bye and Bye
Happy Days and Auld Lang Syne

And she said, I'll be wearing my smile like a mask
And I'll care for each stranger I kiss
And no-one will know that I'm wounded and cheated
So close to my moment of bliss
And sometimes you never connect with a song
Till it's telling the way that you feel
Putting words to your story, all the pain and the glory
How can it be written so real

How I wish I knew
All the old songs they're singing
Such comfort they're bringing
To a heart that's as empty as mine
O it lifts you so high
Does the Sweet Bye and Bye
Happy Days and Auld Lang Syne
