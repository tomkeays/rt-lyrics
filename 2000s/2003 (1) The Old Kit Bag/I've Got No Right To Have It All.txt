I've Got No Right To Have It All

I wish you well
And darling keep in touch
And if he loves you
I hope he loves you as much
It's just my fantasy
You leaving him for me
I've Got No Right To Have It All

Life's little gifts
I know I've had my share
And for a while
I know I had you there
Who carries the pain
For me to love again
I've Got No Right To Have It All

If time stopped in it's tracks
Is that what paradise might be
I'll cling like a drowning man
To my driftwood piece of memory
And where's the peace of mind
Among the debris left behind

This is the point
Where we act crazy or sane
We walk away now
Never to embrace again
I'll say God bless
And wish you happiness
I've Got No Right To Have It All
