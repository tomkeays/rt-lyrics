O sweet Rosie Lee
Like a sister to me
But you thought I was playing you smart

Jealous Words
Won't lie still
In my heart

You saw us there dancing
And you thought us romancing
Suspicion has ripped us apart

With your interpretation
On my reputation
You blinded yourself to the truth
To add some more weight
To your ramblings of late
Well, dear won't you bring us some proof

How you cursed and you cried
As you locked me outside
You said I was bad from the start

How your father abused
And your mother accused
They said I was acting a part

O I knew when we met
You'd never forget
Each pothole and bump in the road
And if I left your side
What a blow to your pride
You're that better than me, I suppose

O the doubt in me's growing
And it hurts me just knowing
Another night's sleep will depart
