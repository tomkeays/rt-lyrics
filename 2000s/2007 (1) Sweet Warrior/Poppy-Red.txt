Poppy-Red

Here my love used to lie
Like a pearl by my side
Everything sweet, everything so complete
Now my love makes her bed
Where poppies grow over her head
There in a field, there in a field
Warm and red - as the blood she shed

Now everything is Poppy-red
Poppy-red, Poppy-red
In loving memory
Now everything is Poppy-red
Poppy-red, Poppy-red
The gifts she gave to me
In loving memory, memory

She said, There's a wind that blows
And where it blows from, who knows
And if I don't go, I'll never know peace of mind'
Now everything's upside down
Everything's turned around
She was my first, she was my last
She was my friend until the end

I'll always see her that way
Dressed in the red, white and grey
Slowly she turned, slowly she turned
Into the rain and walked away
