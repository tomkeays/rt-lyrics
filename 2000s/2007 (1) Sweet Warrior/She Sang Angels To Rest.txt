She Sang Angels To Rest
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Sweet Warrior   (2007)

She charmed me from my cocoon
She eclipsed the sun and the moon
All that summer my feet never walked on the Earth

She sang angels to rest
She sang angels to rest
How do you fall when you already fell for the best
(How do you love when your heart isn't well)

She had that smile on her face
When her thoughts were some other place
All that summer my feet never walked on the Earth

She had that look in her eyes
Like she'd seen a ghost walking by
All that summer my feet never walked on the Earth
