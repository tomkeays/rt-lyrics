One thing always leads to another
In life and love they say
You got too close and now
That boy's gonna make you rue the day
You grab his ankles when he flies
You catch him when he falls
Here's the thing to say to him
Before you climb the walls:

Shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey
One day you're up, next day you're down
Why do you monkey my heart around
Shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey
I'm not coming on the roller coaster with you

I see your nerves are jangled, honey,
You're a walking emotional wreck
He's dealing you some jokers
Off the bottom of the deck
He goes from joy to suicide
About 15 times a day
Here's the thing to scream out loud
From 100 miles away

Shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey
One day you're up, next day you're down
Why do you monkey my heart around
Shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey
I'm not coming on the roller coaster with you

Where's the joy in a boy who dribbles
When he drinks his tea
I've seen better manners from
a baby chimpanzee
On fairground rides you grip the sides
And scream until you're blue
You'll be screaming the rest of your life
If he gets hold with you
