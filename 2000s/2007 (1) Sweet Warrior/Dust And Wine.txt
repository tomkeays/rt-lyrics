Dust and wine
That's what my world is
Dust and wine
That's what she said
Everything I hold seems to crumble
So I hold a bottle instead

Dust and wine
Ashes and sorrow
Dust and wine
And a pauper's bed
So I drink like no tomorrow
Dust and wine

Pipe dreams of mine let me down
Assembly line let me down
Partners in crime let me down
Jemima let me down too

Friends are gone and
Love is gone and
Light is fading from my eyes
Pour me wine against the darkness
Light a lamp to burn inside

Dust and wine
Easy on the throttle
Dust and wine
That's what she said
Take your pick
Me or the bottle
Dust and wine

O landlord fetch me something
To get my valves pumping
I see it all clearly
When I'm flying way up here

Dust and wine
Living like a wino
Dust and wine
Clear out of my head
Got my nose
Down on the lino
Dust and wine
