Any Old Body

If it's all the same to you
I'll sit down on my pew
So I don't fall
I've been let down, oh yes
But nothing quite like this
That I recall

I could have been anybody
Anybody would do you
Any old body
Any old body
Any old body would do

And your little lies still cost
Though you had your fingers crossed
Nothing's for free
And stealing's still a crime
If it's one piece at a time
Like you stole me

I could have been anybody
Anybody would do you
Any old body
Any old body
Any old body would do

Unique, original, one of a kind
Special doesn't come to mind
I'm hypnotized, cut to size
In your arms and in your eyes
Used, abused, confused is more
The picture I'd be aiming for
I'll just be your lump of flesh
Your temporary interest

I could have been anybody
Anybody would do you
Any old body
Any old body
Any old body would do
