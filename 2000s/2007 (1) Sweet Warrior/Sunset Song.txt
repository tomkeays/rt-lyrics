With you or without you, love,
I must be moving
Never meant to linger here so long
With you or without you,
though it breaks my heart
To hear the Sunset Song

Wasn't that a time we had,
and bless you for it
But I'm a stranger here, I don't belong
The band's down on the jetty,
if you cup your ear
You'll hear the Sunset Song

You said, if I hold my breath
Dive down deep enough
I might grow fins
Seems to me I've held my breath
Held my breath to please you
ever since

Early morning, that's the time
for fare-thee-wells
Slip out of the warm sheets and gone
But I want to hear it as I walk along
Hear the Sunset Song

In your waking, in your dreams,
I won't be martyred
On that cross where some say
I belong
Opinions are coffins, I'll just trust my feet
To find the Sunset Song

Every day I'll wear your memory
Like a favourite shirt upon my back
In the hallway, there's my suitcase
By the door, I never did unpack

With you or without you, love,
I must be moving
Never meant to linger here so long
With you or without you,
though it breaks my heart
To hear the Sunset Song
