I can't eat, I can't sleep
Knowing that you're on
your midnight creep
I can't jump. I can't jive
Knowing that you want me
dead or alive
There's no half way with you
You see red, white and blue
What holds your head on
could use another screw

Come on, do your worst, boy
That's the way, that's the way
Hit me where it hurts, boy,
That's the way, that's the way
Puff until you burst, boy
That's the way, that's the way
But I'll Never Give It Up
I'll Never Give It Up

I'll put you in my loser file
I don't need your reptile smile
I prefer you out of range
Stare at somebody else for a change
When the sky fell in, you cried
And blackness welled inside
And how your little brain
got twisted and fried

I don't run, I don't care
Some day we're going to
meet somewhere
You and me will rock and roll
When you crawl out of
your sick little hole
So give me what you got
Put your money in the pot
Let's see what you are and
what you're not

You're someone I can't help betray
Because you built me up that way
