Francesca
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Sweet Warrior   (2007)

Who shook the stars from her eyes
Who shook the stars from her eyes
Who took the shine
Made water out of wine
And left her alone in the world

Who put a cloak round her soul
Who put a cloak round her soul
Who stole the prize
That glittered in her eyes
And left her the fool of the world

O Francesca
Who's going to save you now
O Francesca
Who's going to save you now
It takes guts to put your hand up
To risk it all and stand up to the
Tongue twisters
Campaign of whispers

Who dragged her name
through the dirt
Who dragged her name
through the dirt
Trampled it down
Burned it to the ground
Left her the orphan of the world

Who put that twist in her vows
Who put that twist in her vows
Who took her speech
Bent it out of reach
Put out the light of the world

Who laid her down, took her rose
Who laid her down, took her rose
Who took her flower
Now she charges by the hour
Left her the whore of the world
