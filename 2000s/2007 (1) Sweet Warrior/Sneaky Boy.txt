Sneaky Boy, Sneaky Boy
Thought you were one of us
One of our gang
Sneaky Boy, Sneaky Boy
The mole in the tunnel
The canary who sang

While we sad chums
Just scratched our bums
Your heels were pacing
While we dropped blues
And took a snooze
Your mind was racing

Sneaky Boy, Sneaky Boy

Sneaky Boy, Sneaky Boy
Your teeth and your t-shirt
were always too clean
Sneaky Boy, Sneaky Boy
They're writing your name
down in the latrine, boy

And just who chose
Your rebel clothes
Was it your mummy?
We never knew
The side of you
Behind the dummy

Sneaky Boy, Sneaky Boy

Spleen of Mammon, spleen of Midas
Now you scold us, now you chide us
Mammon lung and Midas liver
Now you sell us down the river

You had your look
Right out the book
Of weekend poses
Now we bankrupt
And self-destruct
You smell of roses

Sneaky Boy, Sneaky Boy
