Written by Richard Thompson

Precious One, Precious One
Thought you stood so sweet upon your own two feet
Precious One, Precious One
Thought there was no breeze could bring you to your knees
But I was wrong

Precious One, Precious One
Should have been a light to guide you through the night
Precious One, Precious One
Wanted to believe you had no need to grieve
But I was wrong

I was wrong, I was wrong
Should have wrapped my arms
Around you tight
To say, I’m here
What’s done is done
What’s done is done

Precious one, Precious one
Wish there was a tide to bring me to your side
Precious One, Precious One
Didn’t want to run or leave it all undone
O I was wrong
