How Does Your Garden Grow?
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Front Parlour Ballads   (2005)

You and your big ideas
Taking your time with me
Faithful as I faltered
Steady as I stumbled
A lifeline tossed in a boiling sea

Whose dream was that -
To parcel up my soul and pass the hat?
That’s not a style that suits you much
You lack that tender touch
That brings them back for more
Drove your old man out the door
When you tried it on before

You and your big ideas
And now that the scars don’t show
How Does Your Garden Grow?

Also appears as an instrumental recorded by Richard Thompson
on “156 Strings: Nineteen Totally Original Acoustic Guitarists “
(various artists), 2002, compiled by Henry Kaiser.
