For Whose Sake?
Written by Richard Thompson

For Whose Sake
For Whose Sake
Did I deliver
Sighs of love and vows forever
For Whose Sake
For Whose Sake
Did I learn real from true?

Fast times
What a scene you left behind
Skins shed
Bitter morsels said
And now you shine your little star
And did you come so far
Are you who you think you are?

For Whose Sake
For Whose Sake
Did I endeavour
Pledge myself forever
For Whose Sake
For Whose Sake
I know your signs
And I know your lines
But I don’t know you
I don’t know you
I don’t know you
