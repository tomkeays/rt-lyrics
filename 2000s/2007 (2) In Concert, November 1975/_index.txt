John Wood's 1976 mixes of Calvary Cross and It'll Be Me (both recorded at Oxford Polytechnic on November 27, 1975) were previously released in 1976 on the Island Records 2-lp set (guitar, vocal) (currently out-of-print). John Wood's mix of Calvary Cross is still available on the Island Records U.S. compilation c.d. The Best Of Richard & Linda Thompson: The Island Years (also released in the U.K. as End Of The Rainbow). John Wood's mix of It'll Be Me is still available as a bonus track on the 2004 Island Records U.K. reissue of Hokey Pokey. All other tracks are previously unreleased.

[Note: Two other performances from these 1975 concerts have also been released in the past. (guitar, vocal) included from the Oxford Polytechnic concert on November 27, 1975 Night Comes In, which is currently available as a bonus track on the 2004 Island Records U.K. reissue of Pour Down Like Silver. And the 1991 limited edition cassette Doom Gloom II (Over My Dead Body) included a rough mix of Now Be Thankful from the 1975 tour. Both of these are different performances from those included on the In Concert, November 1975 cd.]
