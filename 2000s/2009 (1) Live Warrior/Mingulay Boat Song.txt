Mingulay Boat Song
Written by traditional, add. lyrics by Hugh Roberton
Appears on  	Live Warrior   (2009)

Heel y'ho, boys, let her go, boys
Heave her head round into the weather
Heel y'ho. Boys, let her go, boys,
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

What care we how white the Minch is
What care we boys for windy weather
When we know that every inch is
Closer homeward to Mingulay

Heel y'ho, boys, let her go, boys
Heave her head round into the weather
Heel y'ho. Boys, let her go, boys,
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

Wives are waiting at the pierhead
Gazing seaward from the heather
Heave for head round and we'll anchor
Ere the sun sets on Mingulay

Heel y'ho, boys, let her go, boys
Heave her head round into the weather
Heel y'ho. Boys, let her go, boys,
Sailing homeward to Mingulay
