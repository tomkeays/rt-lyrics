Well people get love all wrong
But we know how to get along
Well we know love is a-running wild
So put on your rags and war paint little child

We know love is a dangerous friend
Screaming tyres on a hair-pin bend
Never knowing when the pushes spark will end

Oh you gotta push and shove, push and shove
Push and shove if you want to be loved
Push and shove, you gotta push and shove
Push and shove if you want to be loved

Well any fool can find romance
In a Meryl Streep weepie or a drunken dance
Or you find your thrills in Mills and Boon
Or cry for some greasy lounge tune

Well that's tired love for tired old fools
Wet dreams for girls in school
You and me, we know how to bend the rules

Oh you gotta push and shove, push and shove
Push and shove if you want to be loved
Push and shove, you gotta push and shove
Push and shove if you want to be loved

Well who says a man must breathe
And who says a heart must grieve
And who says that life's for the living
And who says the gift's in the giving

Well who's got time for the human touch
Little things that mean so much
When the chips are down the ride is rough enough

Oh you gotta push and shove, push and shove
You gotta push and shove if you want to be loved
You gotta push and shove, push and shove
You gotta push and shove if you want to be loved
(If you want to be loved)
You gotta push and shove, you gotta push and shove
You gotta push and shove if you want to be loved
