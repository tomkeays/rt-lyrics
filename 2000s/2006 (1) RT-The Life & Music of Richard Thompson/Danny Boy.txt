Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the valley side
The summer's gone, and all the roses are dying
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.
