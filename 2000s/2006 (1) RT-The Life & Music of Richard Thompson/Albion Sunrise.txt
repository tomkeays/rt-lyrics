When the sun comes up in the morning and you hear the dancing boys
Mother leave your pots and pans, sister leave your toys
If you have to break a camel's back or pull the crowds apart
You'll find a way to get there when that old time music starts

Just down the street
There's a rattling sound
There's a country band
Playing hand me down
And it's a jamboree

It was in my father's father's time they new a rolling air
And the Albion boys will show you how, they sang it everywhere

And if you come along with us you're numbered as a friend
And the faded flower of England will rise and bloom again

Just down the street
There's a rattling sound
There's a country band
Playing hand me down
And it's a jamboree

The dancers standing three and three are a most illustrious sight
If someone saw a better one then you surely know he lied

You can hear the bells a-ringing as the singer calls them on
They can dance away the night and day and never step it wrong

Albion Sunrise (written by Richard Thompson) [as recorded by The Albion Country Band on Battle Of The Field (1976)]
