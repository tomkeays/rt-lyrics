You thought that you were smart, little tart
When you threw me over for Shorty McKay
You thought that I would take it like a white man
And squeeze your hand as we said goodbye

Now the Police are out there dragging the river
Looking for a body, five foot two
There've been complaints about the drinking water
So they're dragging the river for you

I spent a fortune keeping you quiet
And you found a nice way to pay me back
Now how does the future look without me
From the inside of a sack?

Now the Police are out there dragging the river
Looking for a bone in an Irish stew
God help the worms and God help the fishies
They're dragging the river for you

All my life I've been a coward
You know I never had the courage to fend for myself
Killing you was the best thing I ever did
You worked wonders for my mental health

Now the Police are out there dragging the river
Looking for a body, five foot two
The divers are down and the beaters are out
And they're dragging the river for you
