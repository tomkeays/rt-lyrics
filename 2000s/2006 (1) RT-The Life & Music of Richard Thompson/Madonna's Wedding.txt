Madonna's Wedding
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	"RT" Disc 1 - Walking the Long Miles Home   (2006)

Out of wedlock is my son
Two bastards now instead of one
What can publicly be done
To rectify my honour

A wedding! That'll pull me through
I'll marry husb... father number two
Get me Scotland, that'll do
Just say "It's for Madonna"

Get me a castle nice and old
Lots of armour, lots of mould
Not too shabby, not too cold
Say "It's for Madonna"

A tartan for the bride and groom
A few close friends, there ain't much room
Sting's place for the honeymoon
If we can stand the squalor

Oh, baby Rocco needs a dip
In holy water, ain't it sick
Get me a cathedral, quick
Say "It's for Madonna"

Oh let's do that Scotland thing
Whisky and a Highland Fling
Limo waiting in the wings
To whisk you where you wanna

Oh the locals think it's some big deal
They're flattered by the showbiz spiel
They thought Braveheart was for real
Upon my word of honour

We'll get Hello magazine
To photograph the happy scene
We'll make those other divas green
With envy of Madonna

'Cause you see, my dear, it's down to class
What good's talent? Tits and arse!
If your lifestyle's deeply crass
Like those would-be Madonnas
