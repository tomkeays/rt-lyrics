Oh my name is Amenhotep
I'm a prince of the Nile
When my daddy died
He really went in style
They put him in his burial chamber
With his favourite things
For his afterlife journey
Oh that's because he's a king

Now my daddy is a mummy
He's inside a pyramid
Oh my daddy is a mummy
Close the door, shut the lid
(Join me kids)
My daddy is a mummy
He's inside a pyramid
Oh my daddy is a mummy
Close the door, shut the lid

Well a priest made a potion
And he rubbed him lots
Then they wrapped him up in bandages
Put him in a stone box
Then they covered it in gold
And they sealed it up tight
'Cause you wouldn't want him sneaking out
In the middle of the night

Well my daddy is a mummy
He's inside a pyramid
Oh my daddy is a mummy
Close the door, shut the lid

Three thousand years later
Ah it's really too bad
They put him in a museum
Won't you come and see my dad

Oh my daddy is a mummy
He's inside a pyramid
My daddy is a mummy
Close the door, shut the lid

Yes my name is Amenhotep
Be my penpal, write to me
Just send me a postcard
To a 1000 BC
Then send it off to Egypt
Well that's the name of my land
But please write in hieroglyphics
Or I won't understand

Yeah my daddy is a mummy
He's inside a pyramid
Ohh, my daddy is a mummy
Close the door, shut the lid
Aay my daddy is a mummy
He's inside a pyramid
Oh my daddy is a mummy
Close the door, shut the lid
