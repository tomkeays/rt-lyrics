Little Sally Racket
Haul 'er Away!
Pawned my favourite jacket
Haul 'er Away!
And then she's lost the ticket
Haul 'er Away!
To my a hauley high-O!
Haul 'Er Away!

Little Nancy Dawson
Haul 'er Away!
Ran off with the parson
Haul 'er Away!
Now she's got a little bosun
Haul 'er Away!
To my a hauley high-O!
Haul 'Er Away!

Up my fightin' cocks now
Haul 'er Away!
You all get your grog now
Haul 'er Away!
For we have worked enough now
Haul 'er Away!
To my a hauley high-O!
Haul 'Er Away!
