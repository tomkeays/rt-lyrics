In Over Your Head
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	"RT" Disc 5 - Real Rarities   (2006)

Run ragged and wounded so deep
Close your eyes, poor body asleep
I could never stand to watch you
In over your head, in over your head
And now I watch you torn and hung by a thread

If you called me I never did hear
Couldn't tell when the need was real
Saw you slipping, you were already gone
In over your head, in over your head
I had nothing new, nothing new to show to you instead
