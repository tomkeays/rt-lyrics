Oh Dear Janet Jackson
You don't know me but I saw you on the telly
You were wobbling like a jelly
When you gave that song some welly
I couldn't help but notice that you have a pair of beauties
And if your other duties
As a diva give you time

There are lots of hungry babes out there who need something to chew
A role as a wet-nurse might be just the thing for you

If you must shove your titty in somebody's face
Shove it in a baby's
Shove it in a baby's
Shove it in a baby's
If you must shove your titty in somebody's face
Shove it in a baby's
Tits are a tease and fun to squeeze
But babies need them too

When you flashed your titty at the super bowl
I hope it wasn't plastic
Or silicon or elastic
Or anything that drastic
When you flashed your titty at the supper bowl
I hope it wasn't plastic
Cause i have heard tell that for babies well
Them implants just won't do

When you shoved that spike right through your nipple
I hope you didn't burst it
I hope you didn't burst it
I hope you didn't burst it
When you shoved that spike right through your nipple
I hope you didn't burst it
Can't have it leaking all down the sides
While feeding a kid or two

That's what they're there for
That's what they're there for
Who are we to ask the why or wherefore
That's what they're there for
That's what they're there for
Now tits are a tease and fun to squeeze but babies need them too

When you are sick of all that dancing around
You'll make a lovely mother
Kids are such a pleasure
Just ask your brother
When you are sick of all that dancing around
I hope you have a dozen
But sleep overs at neverland will be strictly taboo

If you must shove your titty in somebody's face
Shove it in a baby's
Shove it in a baby's
Shove it in a baby's
If you must shove your titty in somebody's face
Shove it in a baby's
Now tits are a tease and fun to squeeze but babies need them too

That's what they're there for
That's what they're there for
And who are we to ask the why or wherefore
That's what they're there for
That's what they're there for
Now tits are a tease and fun to squeeze but babies need them too
