If you've handed me one, you've handed me a thousand shady lies
And if I needed someone, I found someone to cut me down to size
With every word you say, I'm learning every day
'Cause you keep handing me those shady, shady lies

Don't you want me to be just someone you can call on when you're down
Don't you want me to be waiting 'till you turn your head around
I think I must be mad, I'm thinking I've been had
'Cause you keep handing me those shady, shady lies

You're hiding your smile for the last time
Don't mention my name when I'm gone

If you've handed me one, you've handed me a thousand shady lies
And if I needed someone, I found someone to cut me down to size
With every word you say, I'm learning every day
'Cause you keep handing me those shady, shady lies
You keep handing me those shady, shady lies
You keep handing me those shady, shady lies

Shady Lies (written by Richard Thompson) [as recorded by Marc Ellington on Marc Time (1975)]
