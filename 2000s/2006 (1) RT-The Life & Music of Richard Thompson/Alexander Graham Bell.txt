Alexander Graham Bell
Note the name and note it well
Father of the modern age
His inventions are all the rage
Of course there was the telephone
He'd be famous for that alone
But there's 50 other things as well
From Alexander Graham Bell

Edison had cylinders
But Bell made records flat
Which we remember gratefully
When we play our floppy or CD
Of course there was the telephone
He'd be famous for that alone
But there's 50 other things as well
From Alexander Graham Bell

Born in Scotland, moved away
To Canada and the USA
Studied speech, took a wife
Helped the deaf all his life
Came up with a threshing machine
Before he made it to a teen
After years of sweat and toil
He invented the hydrofoil

The respirator was his chance
To save his baby's life
And just like the Brothers Wright
He got heavily into flight
Of course there was the telephone
He'd be famous for that alone
But there's 50 other things as well
From Alexander Graham Bell

Graham Bell, Alexander,
It is tantamount to slander
To call him just a scientist
Why his inventions top the list
Edison, he was a thief
And Tesla nuts beyond belief
But Alexander was a gent
So philanthropic, so well meant

Founded Science Magazine
Wrote a book for kids
Because he was a caring fellow
Gave a hand to Helen Keller
Of course there was the telephone
He'd be famous for that alone
But there's 50 other things as well
From Alexander Graham Bell

Alexander Bell, Graham
Modern life would sure be mayhem
Without tetrahedral cells
X-rays, faxes, decibels
I think I'd say, and it's no fiction
Without fear of contradiction
He improved our lot a smidgeon
From the age of carrier pigeon

Television was a thing
That he had all prepared
But he left that to his pupil
John Logie Baird
Of course there was the telephone
He'd be famous for that alone
But there's 50 other things as well
From Alexander Graham Bell
