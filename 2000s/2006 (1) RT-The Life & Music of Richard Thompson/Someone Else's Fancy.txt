I went to the fair to win me a shilling
And catch the girl with the fish's tail
All I won was a bearded lady
And all I caught was a humpback whale
I was a boy of the finest intentions
Just a victim of somebody's mind
That was a time when my pockets did jingle
And jangle, now it's gone, thrown away
It's gone, thrown away
On someone else's fancy

I went to the market to sell lucky heather
And Buy a dance with the carnival queen
All that I sold was an egg to a chicken
And danced with the strangest girl I'd ever seen
The people were dressed up in funny disguises
And crawling around on the floor
That was a time when my pockets did jingle
And jangle, now it's gone, thrown away
It's gone, thrown away
On someone else's fancy

I went to the races to look for a winner
And lose my heart to the belle of the day
All I found was a hole in the ground
And I lost me shirt on the three legged bay
There was a rich girl but she couldn't see me
With blinkers up over her eyes
That was a time when my pockets did jingle
And jangle, now it's gone, thrown away
It's gone, thrown away
On someone else's fancy

I went to the priest and I said please forgive me
I never dreamed I'd turn up such a lout
All that I want is a brief confrontation
With this thing that everyone's talking about
The priest waved his finger and he said "How's yer fathers"
And we walked away hand in hand
That was a time when my pockets did jingle
And jangle, now it's gone, thrown away
It's gone, thrown away
And the wind blows through my purse
And I'm Cursing the day
That I threw it all away
On someone else's fancy
