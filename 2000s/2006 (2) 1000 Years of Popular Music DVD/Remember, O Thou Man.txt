Remember, O thou man,
O thou man, O thou man,
Remember O thou man,
Thy time is spent.
Remember, O thou man,
How thou cams't to me then,
And I did what I can,
Therefore repent.

Remember Adam's fall,
O thou man, O thou man!
Remember Adam's fall
From heaven to hell!
Remember Adam's fall,
How we were condemned all
To hell perpetual,
There for to dwell.

Remember God's goodness,
O thou man, O thou man!
Remember God's goodness,
And promise made!
Remember God's goodness,
How His only Son He sent
Our sins for to redress,
Be not afraid.

The angels all did sing,
O thou man, O thou man!
The angels all did sing,
On Sion hill
O thou man, O thou man!
The angels all did sing,
Praises to our glorious King,
And peace to man living,
With a good will!'

The Shepherds amazed was,
O thou man, O thou man!
The Shepherds amazed was,
To hear the angels sing,
The Shepherds amazed was
How it should come to pass
That Christ our Messias
Should be our King!

To Bethlehem did they go,
O thou man, O thou man!
The shepherds three;
O thou man, O thou man!
To Bethlehem did they go,
To see whether it were so,
Whether Christ were borne or no
To set man free.

As the Angels before did say,
O thou man, O thou man!
As the Angels before did say,
So it came to pass;
As the Angels before did say,
They found him wrapt in hay
In a manger, where he lay
So poor he was.

In Bethlehem he was born,
O thou man, O thou man!
In Bethlehem he was born,
For mankind's sake;
In Bethlehem he was born,
For us that were forlorn,
And therefore took no scorn
Our sins to bear.

In a manger laid he was,
O thou Man, O thou Man,
In a manger laid he was
At this time present.
In a manger laid he was,
Between an ox and an ass,
And all for our trespass,
Therefore repent.

Give thanks to God always,
O thou man, O thou man!
Give thanks to God always,
With heart most joyfully
Give thanks to God always,
Upon this blessed day,
Let all men sing and say:
'Holy, holy!'
