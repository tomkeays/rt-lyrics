See my friends,
See my friends,
Playin' 'cross the river,

See my friends,
See my friends,
Playin' 'cross the river,

She is gone,
She is gone and now there's no one left
'Cept my friends,
Playin' 'cross the river,

She just went,
She just went,
Went across the river.

Now she's gone,
Now she's gone,
Wish that I'd gone with her.

She is gone,
She is gone and now there's no one left
'Cept my friends,
Playin' 'cross the river,

She is gone and now there's no one else to take her place
She is gone and now there's no one else to love
'Cept my friends,
Playin' 'cross the river,

See my friends,
See my friends,
Playin' 'cross the river,

See my friends,
See my friends,
Playin' 'cross the river,

Inspired by a stopover in Bombay in 1965. Ray Davies was moved by the droning song of fisherman on the beach at dawn. Dave Davies cites an influence by Davy Graham. Usually considered the first 'oriental' pop song.
