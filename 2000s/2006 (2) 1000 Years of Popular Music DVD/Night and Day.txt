Night and Day
Written by Cole Porter, 1932
Appears on  	1000 Years of Popular Music DVD   (2006)

Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
Its no matter darling where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffics boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you

Day and night, night and day
Under the hide of me
Theres an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment wont be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

Day and night, night and day

From The Gay Divorcee. Originally sung in the stage production by Fred Astaire. This song was apparently inspired by Porter's feelings for choreographer Nelson Barclift.
