Woohoo
Woohoo

Debbie just hit the wall
she never had it all
one Prozac a day
husbands a CPA
her dreams went out the door
when she turned twenty four
only been with one man
what happen to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress
she was gonna be a star
she was gonna shake her ass
on the hood of white snake’s car
her yellow SUV is now the enemy
looks at her average life
and nothing has been alright

Springstein, Madonna
way before Nirvana
there was U2 and Blondie
and music still on MTV
her two kids in high school
they tell her that she’s uncool
but she still preoccupied
with 19, 19, 1985

Woohoo
(1985)
Woohoo

Sheâ€™s seen all the classics
she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
even Saint Elmo’s Fire
she rocked out to wham
not a big Limp Biscuit fan
thought she’d get a hand
on a member of Duran Duran

Where’s the mini-skirt made of snake skin
and who’s the other guy singing in Van Halen
when did reality become T.V.
what ever happen to sitcoms, game shows
(on the radio there was)

Springstein, Madonna
way before Nirvana
there was U2 and Blondie
and music still on MTV
her two kids in high school
they tell her that she’s uncool
but she still preoccupied
with 19, 19, 1985

Woohoo

She hates time make it stop
when did Motley Crew become classic rock?
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop
Stop!
And bring back
