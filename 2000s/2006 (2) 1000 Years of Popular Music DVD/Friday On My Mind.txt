Friday On My Mind
Written by George Young and Harry Vanda, 1966
Appears on  	1000 Years of Popular Music DVD   (2006)

Monday morning feels so bad,
Ev'rybody seems to nag me
Coming tuesday I feel better,
Even my old man looks good,
Wednesday just don't go,
Thursday goes too slow,
I've got Friday on my mind

Chorus

Gonna have fun in the city,
Be with my girl she's so pretty,
She looks fine tonight,
She is out of sight to me,
Tonight....I spend my bread,
Tonight...I lose my head,
Tonight...I got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind.

Do the five day drag once more,
Know of nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich man,
Hey I'll change that scene one day,
Today I might be mad,
Tomorrow I'll be glad,
I've got Friday on my mind,

(Repeat Chorus)

The Easybeats were an Australian-based band composed of three Brits and two Dutch nationals, including ex-Mojo drummer Gordon "Snowy" Fleet. This is one of the classic Merseybeat era pop songs.
