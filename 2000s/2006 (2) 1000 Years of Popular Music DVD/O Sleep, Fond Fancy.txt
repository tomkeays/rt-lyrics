O sleep, fond fancy, my head alas, thou tirest
With false delight of that which thou desirest.
Sleep, I say, fond fancy, and leave my thoughts molesting
Thy master's head hath need of sleep and resting.
1590

Written by Thomas Morley (1557 or 8 - 1602)

A three-part madrigal, being a part song for several voices, unaccompanied. This type of madrigal Morley described as a Canzonet - " a little short song wherein little art can be shewed; being made in strains...and every strain repeated except in the middle." Morley was also the composer of teh favourite setting of "It Was a Lover And His Lass" in Shakespeare's As You Like It.
