Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away, you rollin' river
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away. we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away, you rollin' river.
Indians camp along her border
Look away. we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Well a white man loved an indian maiden
Look away, you rollin' river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Look away, you rollin' river
It was for her I'd cross the water.
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

For seven long years I courted sally
Look away, you rollin' river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear,
I'm bound to leave you
Look away you rollin' river
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

A work song on the old square-rigged sailing ships, for turning the capstan. The Shenandoah mentioned is more likely the one in Iowa, hence the 'Wide Missouri'.

Some claim that this was a US cavalry song before it was evea sea shanty. There are verses contained in several of dozens of variants about the love of an Indian maiden, but I prefer the stripped down nautical version. There is a Shenandoah off the Missouri River, another in Virginia - take your pick.
