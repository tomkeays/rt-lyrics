Thy hand, Belinda; darkness shades me
On thy bosom let me rest
More I would, but Death invades me
Death is now a welcome guest

When I am laid, am laid in earth,
May my wrongs create
No trouble, no trouble in thy breast;

When I am laid, am laid in earth,
May my wrongs create
No trouble, n trouble in thy breast;

Remember me, remember me
But ah! forget my fate

Remember me,
But ah! forget my fate

Remember me, remember me
But ah! forget my fate

Remember me,
But ah! forget my fate

From Dido and Aeneas, by Henry Purcell. Aeneas has been tricked away to war by the witches, and Queen Dido, in despair, is about to kill herself. First performed at a School For Gentlewomen in Chelsea in 1689.
