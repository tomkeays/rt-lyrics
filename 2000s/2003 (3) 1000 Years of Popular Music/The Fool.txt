Gather round me buddies,

Hold your glasses high,
And drink to a fool, a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye.

Too late he found out he loves her,
So much he wants to die.
But drink to a fool, a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye.

He needs her, he needs her so.
He wonders why he let her go-oo-oo.

She's found a new love, buddy,
He's a lucky guy,
So drink to the fool, 'cause I'm that fool who told his baby goodbye.

(instrumental break)

He needs her, he needs her so.
He wonders why he let her go-oo-oo.

She's found a new love, buddy,
He's a lucky guy,
So drink to the fool, 'cause I'm that fool who told my baby goodbye.
My baby goodbye,
Who told my baby, who told my baby.......
