Now my name it is Sam Hall, 
Chimney sweep.
Oh my name it is Sam Hall, 
Chimney sweep.
My name it is Sam Hall,
And I robbed both great and small,
And now I pays for all.
Well, damn your eyes. 

Well, they say I killed a man,
So they said.
Oh, they say I killed a man,
So they said.
Well, I hit him on the head,
With a great big lump of lead,
And I left him there for dead.
Well, damn his eyes. 

So, they put me in a quad,
In a quad.
Yes, they put me in a quad, 
In a quad.
Oh, they put me in a quad 
And they tied me to a log,
And they left me there, by God.
Well, damn their eyes. 

And the preacher he did come,
He did come.
Yes, the preacher he did come,
He did come.
Well, the preacher he did come,
And he spoke to Kingdom Come,
Well, he can kiss my bloody bum.
Well, damn his eyes. 

And the hangman he comes too,
He comes too.
And the hangman he comes too,
He comes too.
Well, the hangman he comes too,
And all his bloody crew,
Saying, Sam, there's work to do.
Well, damn his eyes. 

So, it's up the rope I'll go,
Rope I'll go.
And it's up the rope I'll go,
Rope I'll go.
Well, it's up the rope I'll go, 
And I see's you down below,
Saying, Sam, we told you so.
Well, damn your eyes. 

And, I see's Molly in the crowd,
In the crowd.
I see's Molly in the crowd,
In the crowd.
I see's Molly in the crowd,
And I hollers right out loud,
Molly, ain't you bloody proud?
Well, damn your eyes. 

So, this will be my knell,
Be my knell.
Yes, this will be my knell,
Be my knell.
This will be my funeral knell,
And I'll see you all in hell,
And I hope you frizzles well.
Well, damn your eyes.


This version based on that of W.G. Ross. Composer unknown. Performed in the disreputable Cyder Cellars in Maiden Lane, London. Probably derived from an
earlier song about Captain Kidd:
My name was Captain Kidd. And God's laws I did forbid
And most wickedly I did. When I sailed

Ross was from Glasgow, but slowly made his way to London, where he achieved his success; but like many Music Hall performers, he died destitute.
