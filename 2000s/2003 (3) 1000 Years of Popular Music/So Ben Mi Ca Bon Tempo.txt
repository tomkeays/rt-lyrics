Composed by Orazio Vecchi (1550-1605), a cathedral musician from Modena, Italy, who was widely fanous for his secular compositions. There might be a bit of cuckolding going on in the lyric. There is a dance that goes with this.

So ben mi ch' a bon tempo
Al so ma basta mo'
So ben ch' e favorito
Ahime, no' l posso dir
Saluti e baciamani
son tutti indarno a fe
Passeggia pur chi vuole
che 'l tempo perdera

Alternatively:
So ben mi c'ha bon tempo
Il so ma basta mo

So ben che favorito
Ahime! No'l posso dir

O s'io pottessi dire
Chi va chi sta chi vien

La ti dara martello
Per farti disperar

Additional verse:
Saluti e baciamani
Son tutto indarno a fe

John Horton translates it as:

I know a lucky fellow
I know but I won't tell

I know that he's in favour
I'm sorry I can't say

I wish that I could tell you
Who goes, who stays, who comes

I'm sure you would be jealous
And maybe you'd despair

This obviously written in secular spare time:

I know a lucky fellow. But I can't say who it is
He seems to be quite a favourite. But my lips are sealed
O! If I could only tell you. Who comes, who goes, who stays.
But if I did, You would probably despair.
