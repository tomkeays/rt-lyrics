King Henry V's Conquest Of France
Written by trad., arr. by Thompson
Appears on  	1000 Years of Popular Music   (2003)

Based on the true story of the King of France's nicely insulting gift of a barrel of tennis balls to King Henry V of England - the ballad changes it to a more calculating three tennis balls. Amazingly collected in the 1928 in Cade's Cove, Tennessee, long after it had disappeared from England. This version slightly rendered into more modern English, and the odd missing line added.
