I was walking along minding my business, when out of an orange colored sky
Flash, bam, alakazam, wonderful you came by, I was humming a tune,

Drinking in sunshine, when out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alakazam, I got a look at you

One look and I yelled timber, watch out for flying glass
'cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out, I went into a spin
And I started to shout, I've been hit, this is it, this is it

I was walking along minding my business, when love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alakazam, out of an orange colored sky

Well, one look and I yelled timber, watch out for flying glass
'cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out, I went into a spin
And I started to shout I've been hit, this is it, this is it

I was walking along, minding my business, when love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alakazam, out of an orange, colored, purple stripes
Pretty green polka dot sky, flash, bam, alakazam, went the sky

Borrowed this from a Nat King Cole record - jazz gets a little zanier!
