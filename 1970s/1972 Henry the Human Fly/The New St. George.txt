Written by Richard Thompson

The time has come for action
Leave your satisfaction
Can't you hear St. George's tune
St. George's tune is calling on you
Freedom was your mother
Fight for one another
Leave the factory, leave the forge
Dance to the new St. George

Don't believe pretenders
Who say they would defend us
While they flash their teeth and wave
The other hand is being paid
They choke the air and bleed us
These noble men who lead us
Leave the factory, leave the forge
Dance to the new St. George

The fish and foul are ailing
The farmer's life is failing
Where are all the backroom boys
The backroom boys can't save us now
We're poisoned by the greedy
Who plunder on the needy
Leave the factory, leave the forge
Dance to the new St. George
