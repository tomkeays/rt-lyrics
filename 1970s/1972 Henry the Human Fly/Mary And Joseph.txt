Mary And Joseph
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Henry the Human Fly   (1972)

Mary and Joseph were watching the border
Lovers with a different pose
Like the worm that loves the rose
Mary is in stitches
She's tied down on the bed
While Joseph plays the ukelele
Standing on his head

Sad is the hour that saw them divided
People with a common blood
Parted in the name of good
The father and the mother
Of the royal king on earth
He'll only come when hearts are joined
And peace rings in his birth.
