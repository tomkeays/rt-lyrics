Painted Ladies
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Henry the Human Fly   (1972)

It's a grey, grey morning, and the rain it do fall
I'm feeling hungry and low
My bed's so empty, I wish I could call
On the painted ladies I know
When you've got no credit, don't hold no sway
With the painted ladies I know
It's thank you for nothing, we'll see you someday
The painted ladies I know

Leave at home, what you value enough
And laugh all your senses away
When you want to love everyone, how can you love
The painted ladies all say
Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them, please, not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special
The painted ladies I know
If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children playing their game,
The end of the game is goodbye

They pass through your vision like thoughts in a dream
Your good times are slipping way
It's time to move on or go down with the ship,
The painted ladies all say.
