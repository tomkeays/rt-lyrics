It's been raining for a long time and I can't seem to stand
She left about an hour ago and so did the band
I'm sitting at the bar with my face in the jar
And something tells me I'm twisted
Wo ho sitting at the bar with my face in the jar
And something tells me I'm twisted

People are looking hazy and people are looking dim
I'd go for help if I could find the way I came in
I feel in clover, it's time to keel over
Something tells me I'm twisted
Wo ho sitting at the bar with my face in the jar
And something tells me I'm twisted

Here's the one to lay you out with Charlie in the trough
This one's got your name on it written in the froth
Draining the dregs, I'm running out of legs
Something tells me I'm twisted
Wo ho sitting at the bar with my face in the jar
And something tells me I'm twisted
Wo ho sitting at the bar with my face in the jar
And something tells me I'm twisted
