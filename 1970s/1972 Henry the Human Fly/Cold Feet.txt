Cold Feet
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Henry the Human Fly   (1972)

I know you're the wayward kind
The way you always drag behind
You show me a horse and I'll feed it in hay
You show me the cart and I'll throw it away
Prettiest face I've ever seen
You look like something in a magazine
To a blind man it's plain to see
That I need you and you need me

I've got cold feet, it's a crazy chasing
When things get serious time is a wasting
I'd cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha

You took me home to tell your dad
That you were the best girl I've ever had
I stayed for dinner, I couldn't refuse
I spilled the tea and I ate the news
Oh you must think you're really neat
Got me tied down to my seat
And I can't move, it's so hard to think
With a cramp in my eyelids and I can't blink

Well I've got cold feet, it's a crazy chasing
When things get serious time is a wasting
I'd cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha
