Well the angels came to see me today
Said "We've taken your racehorse away"
And I believe it was that bookmaker from crail
I believe that he put one in her pail
All the finest in the field
Only measured to her shoulders, they only ever see her heels
And I believe (I believe) every sporting man will cry
I believe (I believe) to see his income pass him by

She won the Lanark Silver Bell and she stole every heart away
She stood her stand at sixteen hands and I'd ride her easy
But they've taken her away, they've taken my racehorse away

There's a racecourse in the sky
And that's where all the racing horses must go by and by
And I believe (I believe) every steward, lord and groom,
I believe (I believe) that they're calling her name

She would look at me in the eyes and that was all she had to say
She stood her stand at sixteen hands and I'd ride her easy
But they've taken, they've taken my racehorse away
They've taken my racehorse away
They've taken my racehorse away
They've taken my racehorse away
They've taken my racehorse away
They've taken my racehorse away.
