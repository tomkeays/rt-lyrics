Wind's gonna blow my blues away
Wind's gonna blow my blues away
I'm gonna throw my shoes away
Saturday rolling around

Moon going down and the sun come up
Moon going down and the sun come up
We're gonna drink from a loving cup
Saturday rolling around

Been too long working for the man
He just don't like my face
Been too long looking for a dream
And looking in the wrong place

Gonna take a train and ride away
Gonna take a train and ride away
Gonna take a ship and slide away
Saturday rolling around

I ain't gonna punch that clock no more
I ain't gonna punch that clock no more
I'm going home gonna lock the door
Saturday rolling around

Working all week from nine to five
Working all week from nine to five
Gonna get down gonna do the jive
Saturday rolling around

Been all week, work so hard
Sweat pour off my face
Saturday night we're gonna get down
And really rock that place

We're going down to Fontaineau
We're going down to Fontaineau
We're gonna dance at the Fais do-do
Saturday rolling around

Wind's gonna blow my blues away
Wind's gonna blow my blues away
I'm gonna throw my shoes away
Saturday rolling around

Moon going down and the sun come up
Moon going down and the sun come up
We're gonna drink from a loving cup
Saturday rolling around

Been too long working for the man
He just don't like my face
Been too long looking for a dream
And looking in the wrong place

Gonna take a train and ride away
Gonna take a train and ride away
Gonna take a ship and slide away
Saturday rolling around
