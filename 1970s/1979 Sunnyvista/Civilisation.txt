They're not human, they're with the Woolwich
They eat food I wouldn't give to my dog
They're hygienic, medicated
They wouldn't live next door to no wog
They're not human, where do they come from?
I don't know what they're living here for
They don't belong here, on this planet
What are they doing in the house next door?

Wife's tranquilized, milk's pasteurized
Kid's hypnotized by the t.v.
Dad'll beat you, dog'll eat you
They'll treat you like family

All across the nation
It's civilisation

They're not human, they've got a new car
They're going to polish it all the day long
Got a brand new rubber woman
They're going to blow her up all the night long
They're not human, it's a double cross
They sold out for a handful of beads
They sold everything for nothing, just a
Headful of dreams and a handful of greed

Keep 'em happy, keep 'em drinking
Keep 'em laughing, no thinking
No dying, no weeping
Keep 'em hypnotized, keep 'em sleeping

All across the nation
It's civilisation

Pack you off to school, get working
Get a steady job, no shirking
Get to sixty-five, get a handshake
You're a vegetable with a heartache

All across the nation
It's civilisation
