Remember the time when we two kin were reared
There was never a morsel but that it was shared
If the one babe was stung, t'was the other would cry
There scarce was a crossed word and never a lie

Our people were drab and defeated like slaves
The light of their fathers went into the graves
I took to the highway to find some relief
I never meant parting to put you to grief

Sisters
We were sisters
'Til love came between us and pulled us apart
We were sisters
We were sisters
Don't call me your sister and put a knife through my heart

Now you smile when you greet me, you put on a show
But it's slander you're talking as soon as you go
If your eye and my eye don't meet anymore
Hold fast to your tongue when I've walked out the door

Sisters
We were sisters
'Til love came between us and pulled us apart
We were sisters
We were sisters
Don't call me your sister and put a knife through my heart

You say that I'm different, don't hold me to blame
It's not to my grandeur, it's not to your shame
It's nothing of mine that I lay at your door
So take it or leave it, it's to heal not to sore

Sisters
We were sisters
'Til love came between us and pulled us apart
We were sisters
We were sisters
Don't call me your sister and put a knife through my heart
