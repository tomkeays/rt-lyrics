When you're lost in the dark and you can't find a way
When the night is so long you don't remember the day
When you're too far gone to hear anybody call
When your last deal left you with nothing at all

You're going to need somebody, you're going to need somebody
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you

When nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody loves you, nobody feeds you
When your ship is sinking in the middle of a sea
When they locked you in chains and they've thrown away the key

You're going to need somebody, you're going to need somebody
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you

When you don't live long unless you're fast on your feet
When they're taking your furniture right out into the street
When you can't sleep at night for counting cracks on the wall
When your friends build you up just to watch you fall

You're going to need somebody, you're going to need somebody
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you

When you're lost in the dark and you can't find a way
When the night is so long you don't remember the day
When you're too far gone to hear anybody call
When your last deal left you with nothing at all

You're going to need somebody, you're going to need somebody
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you
