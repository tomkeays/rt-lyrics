Written by Richard Thompson
Beeswing Music [The theme tune from the BBC television serial "Kiss the girls and make them cry"]
Appears on  	Sunnyvista   (1979)

My mammy told me, "Listen girl, I really wish you would
That boy that you're fooling with, he won't do you no good"
But me and Georgie fool around, we go out and we hit the town
Eyes of blue, and crazy too, he's rattling the garden gate,
And I can hardly wait--

When Georgie's on a spree
All the girls are jealous of me
'Cause I'm the one he spends his money on
We spend it, one two three,
Riding through the countryside
I'm perfect company
He's the king and I'm his queen
When Georgie's on a spree

We don't see bad company, we mix it with the best
Rubbing shoulders with the green, no time for the rest
And when we're tired of clubs and bars, we take a drive beneath the stars
And when we're tired of stepping out, we put a blanket on the ground
Where there's no one else around

When Georgie's on a spree
All the girls are jealous of me
'Cause I'm the one he spends his money on
We spend it, one two three,
Riding through the countryside
I'm perfect company
He's the king and I'm his queen
When Georgie's on a spree

Georgie says he loves me, then he says he's playing around,
He says he wants his freedom, then he wants to settle down
Now Georgie's had some girls all right, he let them hold him in the dead of night
But when the tables turn on you, o what will you do
When she does the same to you?

When Georgie's on a spree
All the girls are jealous of me
'Cause I'm the one he spends his money on
We spend it, one two one two three,
Riding through the countryside
I'm perfect company
He's the king and I'm his queen
When Georgie's on a spree

He's the king and I'm his queen
When Georgie's on a spree
