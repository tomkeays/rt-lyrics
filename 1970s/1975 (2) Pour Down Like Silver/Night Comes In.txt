Night comes in
Like some cool river
How can there be
Be another day
Take my hand
O real companion
And we'll dance
We'll dance 'till we fade away

O the songs
Pour down like silver
They can only
Only break my heart
Drink the wine
The wine of lovers
Lovers tired of being apart

Dancing 'till my feet don't touch the ground
I lose my mind and dance forever
Lose my mind and dance forever
Turn my world around
Turn my world around

O this night
Is like no other
And this room
Is ringing in my ears
And these friends
Will never leave me
And these tears
Are like no other tears

Dancing 'till my feet don't touch the ground
I lose my mind and dance forever
Lose my mind and dance forever
Turn my world around
Turn my world around

Well I may find
That street tomorrow
Leave the shadow
Of my lonely room
See my one
My one and only
Heart and soul
I'm coming soon
