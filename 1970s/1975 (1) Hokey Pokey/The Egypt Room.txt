The Egypt Room
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Hokey Pokey   (1975)

Now Hobnail Kelly and the Beefcake kid
Just rolled into town from the
Land of sown-up faces
Looking for a woman who can
Punch and kick and bite
Slide on down to the Egypt room
Find the only woman who's
Holding all the aces
The Princess is dancing
At the Egypt Room tonight

Don't be late
Don't be late
Don't be late

She's a nightclub floosie, nothing but a tramp
But she moves like a snake
And she shimmies like a fish in the ocean
She can fool with a man 'till
He doesn't know wrong from right
She's got diamonds flashing, ruby rings
She sparkles like the Nile when
She does her original motion
The Princess is dancing
At the Egypt Room tonight

Now don't be late
Ah don't be late
Oh don't be late

The man with the cane and Italian shoes
He walks like a lion looking
For a lonely Christian
He peeps at the Princess and
His bloodshot eyes open wide
He says, meet me, princess, after the show
I'm a gambling man and I think
I like your system
I'll see you at the back of
The Egypt Room tonight

Now don't be late
Oh don't be late
Ah don't be late
