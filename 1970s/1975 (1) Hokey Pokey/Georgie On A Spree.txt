Me mammy told me, Isabel,
Now don't stay out too late
One day they'll throw you out of school
So get yourself a steady date
But Georgie meets me every night
We go out and we have a bite
Eyes of blue, and money too,
He's rattling the garden gate,
And I can hardly wait-

When Georgie's on a spree
All the girls are jealous of me
'Cause I'm the one he spends his money on
We spend it, one two three,
Driving in his Chevrolet
I'm perfect company
He's the king and I'm his queen
When Georgie's on a spree.

We don't see bad company
We mix it with the best
Rubbing shoulders with the rich
And no time for the rest
When I see something that I need
My Georgie buys the street for me
And when we're tired of the Ritz
He's got a little nest
Where I put him to the test.

When Georgie's on a spree
All the girls are jealous of me
'Cause I'm the one he spends his money on
We spend it, one two three,
Driving in his Chevrolet
I'm perfect company
He's the king and I'm his queen
When Georgie's on a spree.

One day Georgie hung his head
And sadly he did say-
Little girl, I'm leaving you
I have to go away;
But I'll be back in a week or two,
And I'll be thinking just of you
Sit beside your telephone
Until that lucky day
When I come home to stay-

When Georgie's on a spree
All the girls are jealous of me
'Cause I'm the one he spends his money on
We spend it, one two three,
Driving in his Chevrolet
I'm perfect company
He's the king and I'm his queen
When Georgie's on a spree

He's the king and I'm his queen
When Georgie's on a spree.
