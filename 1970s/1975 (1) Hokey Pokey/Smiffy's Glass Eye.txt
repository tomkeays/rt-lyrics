Smiffy's Glass Eye
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Hokey Pokey   (1975)

Smiffy was a little boy, different from the rest
He had one eye pointing East and one pointing West
Ever since Tiny Murphy hit him with a sling
Smiffy with his glass eye glittering
Playing in the school-yard, how the kids would marvel
When Smiffy popped his glass 'un out and used it for a marble
He was such a character the kids would sing
Smiffy with his glass eye glittering

Walking down the street when two big louts
Come and tripped up Smiffy and his eye fell out
They used it as a conker on a piece of string
Smiffy with his glass eye glittering
The girls all laughed when Smiffy passed them by
They called him Cyclops, he only had one eye
He never had a girl-friend, or that sort of thing
Smiffy with his glass eye glittering

Smiffy used to dream of the Judgement Day
When the flood came and carried all his school-friends away
He was lifted up to Heaven on an Angel's wing
Smiffy with his glass eye glittering
Nobody cried when his world fell apart
And poor Smiffy died of a broken heart
You have to turn a blind eye to that sort of thing
Smiffy with his glass eye glittering
