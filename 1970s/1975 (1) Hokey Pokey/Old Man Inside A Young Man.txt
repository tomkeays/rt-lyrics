I was walking down the street
When I met with Billy
He shook his head at me
And then he shook my hand
He said, I've seen the world
And I've done some living
I don't believe in giving
You've got to take it while you can

I'm an old man inside a young man
You've got to take it while you can
I'm just an old man inside a young man
Take a heart and break it while you can

He said, I'm sick of whores,
Madames and misses
The only kiss for me
Is the kiss of a knife
There's no one thing on earth
That I'm not through with
What can I do with
The rest of my life?

I'm an old man inside a young man
You've got to take it while you can
I'm just an old man inside a young man
Take a heart and break it while you can

Billy turned and he walked away
He said, I must be going
There's just no knowing
Who follows me around
They see my fancy clothes
And they want to shoot me
I'd rather be dead on my feet
Than dead down in the ground

I'm an old man inside a young man
You've got to take it while you can
I'm just an old man inside a young man
Take a heart and break it while you can

I'm an old man inside a young man
You've got to take it while you can
I'm an old man inside a young man
Take a heart and break it while you can
I'm just an old man inside a young man
