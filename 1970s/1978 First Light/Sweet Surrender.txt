I gave my heart to you
Oh oh oh oh
I gave my heart to you
Oh oh oh with sweet surrender
Sweet surrender, oh sweet surrender
Allah, Allah, Allah

I'd give the world for you
Oh oh oh oh
I'd give the world for you
Oh oh oh with sweet surrender
Sweet surrender, oh sweet surrender
Allah, Allah, Allah

You make me weak, when you touch my hand
Oh I should run from here but I can't seem to stand
Oh I can't leave you, oh I believe you
And I believe you understand

I feel you next to me
Oh oh oh oh
I feel you next to me
Oh oh oh with sweet surrender
Sweet surrender, oh sweet surrender
Allah, Allah, Allah

Oh I can't leave you, oh I believe you
And I believe you understand

You make my heart beat
Oh oh oh oh
You make my heart beat
Oh oh oh with sweet surrender
Sweet surrender, oh sweet surrender
Allah, Allah, Allah

Sweet, sweet surrender
Sweet, sweet surrender
Sweet, sweet surrender
Sweet, sweet surrender
