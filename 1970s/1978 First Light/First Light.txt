Give me what I ask for
Give me what I long for
First light, first light

I came to you for refuge
Don't leave me to the thieves
Don't leave me to my own
Cure my disease
First light, first light
First light, first light

Take me through the mountains
Lead me from confusion
Take me by the hand
Through real and through illusion
First light, first light
First light, first light

Give me what I ask for
Give me what I long for
Give me what I ask for
Give me what I long for
First light, first light
First light, first light
First light, oh give me what I ask for
First light, give me what I long for
First light, oh give me what I ask for
First light, oh give me what I long for
