Layla

I drew near to the house of Layla
It was then I heard her call
Her sweet voice made me wish that it would never end at all
Oh you say you see some good in me
It's only from her light
Take this being gone from me, don't look to her delight
She was pleased with me, she drew me nearer
She took me into her retreat
Oh she kept my company, she spoke to me
She let me sit at her feet
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla
Layla Layla Layla Layla
Layla Layla Layla Layla

And then she came close to me, the veils fell from my sight
She dazzled me, she bewildered me
Confused me with her light
Well you say you see some good in me, it's only from her light
Take this being gone from me
Don't look to her delight
And then she took me, and then she possessed me
She showed her meaning to me
I thought my soul would be her ransom
I thought that she was me
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla

And then she slew me, she tore me to pieces
Her blood stained like a die
And when I was dead, she brought me to life
My star shone in her sky
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla
Layla Layla Layla Layla
Layla Layla Layla Layla
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla
