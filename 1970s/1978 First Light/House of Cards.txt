Appears on  	First Light   (1978)

Oh the rain is falling (blow blow down)
And the wild wind roars (blow blow down)
It'll shake your windows (blow blow down)
And rattle your doors (blow blow down)
Ah blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

They're washing the streets (blow blow down)
With the blood of your kind (blow blow down)
Ah look over your shoulder (blow blow down)
They are right behind (blow blow down)
Oh blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

The birds are wheeling (blow blow down)
Up above your head (blow blow down)
Ah your days are numbered (blow blow down)
You're as good as dead (blow blow down)
Ah blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

This very fine house (blow blow down)
Of great renown (blow blow down)
It's cracked and shaking (blow blow down)
And a-tumbling down (blow blow down)
Ah blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards
Oh blow down this house of cards
