Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

How many days does a man think he has
That he can spend his whole time dreamin'
How many schemes is one man thinkin' of
And does he think he's the only one scheming

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

Stop your lies and stop your cheating
It never did you no good, no good
How can you say you will when you want to
When you know you never would if you could

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

Everyone is in love with money
Strange news 'cause they say that love is blind
How many times did you meet somebody
Who said they had some real peace of mind

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started
