Cash Down Never Never
Written by Richard Thompson

Young love, I wish you well
Shotgun and wedding bells
Semi-semi and the damp is peeling
Hole in the roof wet the baby's head
Back streets, real scum about
Need a car, a little run-about
Some down and a fistful later
Sign on the line like the nice man said

Need a Slumberland or a Frigidaire
Or a video, sign right there
In over your head, head, cash down.
Never-never. Cash down.
Never-never. Cash down.

Get a job, good overtime
Shop floor, assembly line
Six months and no more company
No more factory, no more shift
Get a job, you're gonna go far
Hot wire and a crow bar
Nobody's gonna feed the baby
That's if they catch you, if, if, if

Vegetating, frustrating
Repossessions, distressing
In over your head, head, cash down.
Never-never. Cash down.
Never-never. Cash down.
Never-never.
Nothing's so hard as living on the easy plan

Need a Slumberland or a Frigidaire
Or a video, sign right there
In over your head, head, cash down.
Never-never. Cash down.
Never-never. Cash down.
Never-never.
Nothing's so hard as living on the easy plan
