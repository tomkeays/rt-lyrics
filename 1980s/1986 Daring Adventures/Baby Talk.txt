Baby Talk
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Daring Adventures   (1986)

Oh I care for you, honey, at my own expense
But something's spoiling my sentiments
You open your mouth and it makes no sense
All you ever give me is baby talk

You're a fine grown woman, and that's a fact
But who could tell from the way you act
When I pull up the car and we climb in the back
All you ever give me is baby talk

I love sweet nothings, sitting in the dark
And I like to bill and coo
But it breaks my heart the minute you start
On goo goo goo and a-coochee coo

You drive me crazy, where will it end
I feel embarassed in front of my friends
It's a wonderful thing that you learned how to walk
All you ever give me is baby talk

Oh well I love sweet nothings, sitting in the dark
And I like to bill and coo
But it breaks my heart the minute you start on
Goo goo goo and a-coochee coo

I'm sending you back to nursery school
When you start talking you sound like a fool
You can't even eat with a knife and a fork
And all you ever give me is baby talk
All you ever give me is baby talk
Well all you ever give me is ....
