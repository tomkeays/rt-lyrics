Hailstones and a sickle moon and the north wind races
One more night of running my mind over lost embraces
The steps you made when you walked away
Still frozen in the ground
Oh missie how you let me down
Oh missie how you let me down
Oh missie how you let me down
And lies won't break my fall
Lies won't break my fall

Your food's still sitting there at the table where you used to be
The shape of you is still in the bed there next to me
Maybe I could find some trace of you to keep around
Oh missie how you let me down
Oh missie how you let me down

For far too long you kept me waiting
Reaching out into empty air
Even now you'd never say it face to face
That you really don't care
And if you never liked pulling teeth
Then why, why did you tie me in the dentist's chair

Ah you left your mark on this old place, that you did
I could stew in here like a pressure cooker and screw down the lid
Or maybe I should just take a match
And burn the whole thing to the ground

Oh missie how you let me down
Oh missie how you let me down
Oh missie how you let me down

Oh missie how you let me down
Oh missie how you let me down
Oh missie how you let me down
And lies won't break my fall
Lies won't break my fall
