This old house is a-tumbling down
The walls are gone but the roof is sound
The landlord’s deaf, he can never be found
It’s time to ring some changes

They’ll arrest you son if you just stand still
They’ll ask you to pose with your hand in the till
They’ll ask you to die when you’ve written your will
It’s time to ring some changes

It’s time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes

O the politicians they look so smug
You say tell the truth and they give you a shrug
You might find the truth swept under the rug
It’s time to ring some changes

You pay for your money for your daily bread
But the bread’s gone up so you need more money
The money’s gone down, better borrow instead
It’s time to ring some changes

Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes

O you fall in love with the girl you’ve seen
Diamond studded on a tv screen
But the change in your pocket won’t buy you a dream
It’s time to ring some changes

So you steal a car and you go for a ride
You end up sleeping with some girl guide
And everything you do leaves you empty inside
It’s time to ring some change

Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
