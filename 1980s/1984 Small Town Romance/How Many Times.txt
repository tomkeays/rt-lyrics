How Many Times
Written by Richard Thompson

You broke my heart so many times
I can't count the pieces
Everytime you push me down
It seems my strength increases
How many times do you have to cry
While people stand there gawking
How many times do you have to fall
Before you end up walking

I tried to give you all I had
To prove that I'm not bluffing
They say it's a man with nothing to lose
Who ends up losing nothing
My head's full of scheming schemes
My tongue's tied up with talking
How many times do you have to fall
Before you end up walking

I tried to give you all I had
I thought my love was strong
I thought that I could treat you right
How did I treat you wrong
O won't you even open the door
To see the wares I'm hawking
How many times do you have to fall
Before you end up walking

O won't you give me one more chance
I couldn't do no worse
Empty out my heart for you
Before it has to burst
I'm too hungry not to win
But you're the game I'm stalking
How many times do you have to fall
Before you end up walking
