Love Is Bad For Business
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Small Town Romance   (1984)

What time of day is this? O you really look a mess
Clean down the tables and help out on the door
It’s just no good to me if you’re in ecstasy
Running all night with that boyfriend of yours

Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Empties the tills and it don’t pay the bills
It’ll do you no good
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Runs down your stocks and it leaves you on
the rocks

It’ll do you no good

You better wipe that Mona Lisa smile off your face
Clean up those broken dishes, scrub down the floor
Wipe the stars out of your eyes, there’s a job to do
And you’ve been dreaming for three weeks or more

Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Drives you insane but you’re doing it again
It’ll do you no good
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Pawn everything just to buy her a ring
It’ll do you no good

Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Empties the tills and it don’t pay the bills
It’ll do you no good
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Runs down your stocks and it leaves you on the rocks
It’ll do you no good

Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
