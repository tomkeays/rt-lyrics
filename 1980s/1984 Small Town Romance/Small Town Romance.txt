Small town romance
Back seat for a bed
Nothings must be whispered
Rumours must be fed

Small town romance
Everyone knows your mind
They peep from faded curtains
They read your valentines

O you got to get away
O you got to get away
O you got to get away
O they can't stand love in a small town

They knew you when you were weaning
They knew you when you were grown
They think they know all about you
They'll never leave you alone

Small town romance
There's too many jealousies
Old maids with long gone lovers
Old flames with bad memories

O you better get away
O you better get away
O you better get away
O they can't stand love in a small town

Midnight packing and leaving
Note pinned upon the sheets
Tail lights off in the distance
A ride through the painted streets

O small town romance
They'd still break you if they could
They'd always say I told you so
She never was no good

See she never loved him anyway
See she never loved him anyway
See she never loved him anyway
O you can't have love in a small town

See she never loved him anyway
See she never loved him anyway
See she never loved him anyway
O you can't have love in a small town
