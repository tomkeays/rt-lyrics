Always move in pairs and travel light
A loose friend is an enemy, keep it tight
Always leave a job the way you found it
Look for trouble coming and move around it

That's the way we make love
That's the way we make love
That's the way we make love

Always make your best moves late at night
Always keep your tools well out of sight
It never pays to work the same town twice
It never hurts to be a little nice

That's the way we make love
That's the way we make love
That's the way we make love

Learn the way to melt into a crowd
Never catch an eye or dress too loud
You've got to be invisible my friend
To find the joy on which we must depend

That's the way we make love
That's the way we make love
That's the way we make love
Love love love love
That's the way we make love
That's the way we make love
