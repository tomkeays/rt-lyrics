Shine On Love
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Across a Crowded Room   (1985)

When I was a boy
I was nobody's joy
I was guilty in love
Guilt, guilt, guilty in love
More fool me
I never could see what I was guilty of

Now you steered me right
And I'm standing in the light
So shine on love
Shine, shine, shine on love
Don't slip away
Darkened day
Let it shine on love
Shine, shine, shine on love

Like a hand in glove
Now we go together
So shine on love
Ah easing my heart again
Just let me be a part of you

Now my head's on that block
And I'm standing on that rock
So shine on love
Shine, shine, shine on love
Well don't slip away
O darkened day
Let it shine on love
Shine, shine, shine on love

Like a hand in glove
Now we go together
So shine on love
Ah easing my heart again
Just let me be a part of you

Now you steered me right
And I'm standing in the light
So shine on love
Shine, shine, shine on love
Don't slip away
Darkened day
Let it shine on love
Shine, shine, shine on love
