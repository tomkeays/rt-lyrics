I keep my nose clean, I keep my speech plain
I keep my promises, she twists the knife again
I shut my memory, I close my eyes and then
She takes another bite, she twists the knife again

She never leaves me my dignity
Makes a dunce of me in mixed company
No bygone can be a bygone
She throws the spanner in, she puts the screws on

In the middle of a kiss, she twists the knife again
When I get up off my knees, she twists the knife again
When I think I'm off the hook she gets me
She twists the knife again, she twists the knife again

I make my moves well, I let her tell me when
I walk a fine line, she twists the knife again
Just when the scar heals, just when the grip unbends
Just when her mind reels, she twists the knife again

She can give it out, she can't take it
She smells something bad, she has to rake it
I bring home my packet, my white-collar money
I'm in a fist fight, she thinks she's Gene Tunney

In the middle of a kiss, she twists the knife again
When I get up off my knees, she twists the knife again
When I think I'm off the hook she gets me
She twists the knife again, she twists the knife again

She never leaves me my dignity
Makes a dunce of me in mixed company
No bygone can be a bygone
She throws the spanner in, she puts the screws on

In the middle of a kiss, she twists the knife again
When I get up off my knees, she twists the knife again
When I think I'm off the hook she gets me
She twists the knife again, she twists the knife again
She twists the knife again
