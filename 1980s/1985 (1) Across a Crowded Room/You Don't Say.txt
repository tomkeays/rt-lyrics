I saw your old flame
Walking down the street
She's back in town again
She's looking out for you
She says you used her
And you were indiscreet
It really wounded her
When you bid adieu

Do you mean she still cares
Do you mean she still cares
Do you mean she still cares
Oh you don't say

Do you mean she still cares (Do you mean she still cares)
Do you mean she still cares (Do you mean she still cares)
Do you mean she still cares
But you don't say (you don't say)

She keeps half a ring
She says you've kept the other
She says you broke your word
When you pursue another
She says "You're getting love
Mixed up with sympathy
Young man, do your duty
And come on back to me"

Do you mean she still cares (Do you mean she still cares)
Do you mean she still cares (Do you mean she still cares)
Do you mean she still cares
Oh you don't say (you don't say)

Oh do you mean she still cares
Do you mean she still cares
Do you mean she still cares
Oh you don't say

She says her heart aches
Like you had bought and sold her
She took all her hopes
And pinned them on your shoulder
She sends you rosemary
And by this gift you're given
Remember love heals
And old wrongs forgiven

Do you mean she still cares (Do you mean she still cares)
Do you mean she still cares (Do you mean she still cares)
Do you mean she still cares
Oh you don't say (you don't say)

Do you mean she still cares
Oh do you mean she still cares
Do you mean she still cares
Oh you don't say
