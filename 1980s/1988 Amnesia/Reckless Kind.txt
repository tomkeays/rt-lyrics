Reckless Kind
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Amnesia   (1988)

Here we stand in sheets of rain
Parting ways, loved in vain
Never knew you'd be the reckless kind

I reached out to catch your fall
Said you needed a place to crawl
Never knew you'd be the reckless kind

The reckless kind, the reckless kind
The reckless kind, the reckless kind
You're his not mine

They say you run with a breakneck crowd
Live your love scenes right out loud
Break hearts all around, you're the reckless kind

You said you were well satisfied
Proud to see me by your side
Pride's a worthless thing to the reckless kind

The reckless kind, the reckless kind
The reckless kind, the reckless kind
You're his not mine

Love lies shattered on the ground
Jagged pieces all around
Say you'll come back but I know you're the reckless kind

Oh the reckless kind, the reckless kind
The reckless kind, the reckless kind
You're his not mine
His not mine
You're the reckless kind
The reckless kind
The reckless kind
