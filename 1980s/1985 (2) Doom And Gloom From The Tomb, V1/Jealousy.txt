Jealousy

I saw you kissing him, telling him lies
I held my breath and I closed my eyes
Oh jealousy

Count to three
And maybe the pain will leave my heart
I'll get used to being apart
Oh jealousy

You're looking at him the way you used to look at me
Just like a wild cat looking at a bird in a tree

Oh you don't love me
But you know that I never stopped loving you
I just can't stand to see the things you do
Oh jealousy

Every time I see you somebody's in my shoes
You were the one thing I could never stand to lose

Oh jealousy
You're breaking me up with your new romance
I'd even take you back if I had the chance
Oh jealousy, jealousy
Oh jealousy, jealousy
