Died for Love (demo)
Written by Richard Thompson

I'm wishing and waiting
Down on the shoreline
Oh tell me, lover
When will you be mine
Sail my ship on the ocean
I'll sail to some far place
And I'll enquire of every captain
Oh have you seen her face?
I'd give my life to be with you

And if they ask about me
And if they ask about me
Oh say that I died
I died for love

Trouble and worry
Why should it mess up your mind
It's nothing, it's just shadows
That you will leave behind
What is my life without trouble
If I'm away from you
Oh I will love you forever
'Till you love me and I love you
I'd give my life to be with you

And if they ask about me
And if they ask about me
Oh say that I died
I died for love

Well true love, the real thing
It don't come easy
And giving and searching
It don't come easy
Of all the flowers in the forest
Of all the birds in the air
Of all the jewels and treasures
Oh how can they compare
I'd give my life to be with you

And if they ask about me
And if they ask about me
Oh say that I died
I died for love
Say that I died
I died for love
And say that I died
I died for love
