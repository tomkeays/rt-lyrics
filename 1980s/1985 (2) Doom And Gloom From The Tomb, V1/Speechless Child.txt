Speechless Child
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Doom And Gloom From The Tomb, V1   (1985)

Oh speechless child, who wants to touch you
Oh speechless child, no love in store
To dumb to scream, to dumb to answer
Can only listen and lock the door
Can't stand the sound of raging voices
Can't stand the sound of warring tongues
Shut in a place where none can reach you
A better place than this cruel one
Oh child, oh child, speechless child

Your mother blames you for her trouble
Your father needs to pick a fight
And you're the smallest and the nearest
Close the door and close it tight
See all the joys of family living
You're better off by far today
Your private life, your private leisure
Oh life is sweeter, so they say
Oh child, oh child, speechless child

Oh speechless child, you'll never reason
Oh speechless child, the day will come
You'll haunt a man whose days are measured
Some day your eyes will strike him dumb
Oh child, oh child, speechless child
Oh child, oh child, speechless child
