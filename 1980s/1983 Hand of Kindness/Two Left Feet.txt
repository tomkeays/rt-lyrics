O two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet
Two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet

Well, your hair is pretty and your face is a treat
But I don't like your two left feet
I'm not one to admit defeat
But I can't win with your two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
But I can't stand them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet

Well, they're pulling people in off the street
They all want to look at your two left feet
Dance with Jimmy, dance with Pete,
Don't dance with me with them two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet o

I dance with you and I land on my seat
That's 'cos you dance with two left feet
You could make my life complete
Just get rid of them two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet

O two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet
Two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet

O two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet
Two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet
