When we parted just like friends
We never tied loose ends
I could never say the words that would make amends

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
To say I loved you
To say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to

From my blue room did you creep
A love too rare to keep
Well I heard your step and I turned my head to weep

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
Say I loved you
Say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
Say I loved you
Just say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to

Now hearts do what hearts will
And my nights are sleepless still
Well I never was the one to speak my fill

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
Just say I loved you
Ah just say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
Say I loved you
Just say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to
