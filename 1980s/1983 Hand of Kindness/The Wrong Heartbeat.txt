Don't think my love is something that you can play with
I'm not the one to spend the time of day with
You learn to hide love, you lock it up or find it gone
You think you need me, you think you read me
From the beating of my heart

But you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
O you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

If you should see a tear, you won't see many
If you should hear me sigh, it's not for any
If you should greet me as I am walking along
You only want to see just the shell of me
You don't know the other part

Well, you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
Ah, listening to the wrong heartbeat
I said, you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

O you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
O listening to the wrong heartbeat
O listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

Don't throw your secrets where men will steal them
You got to hide them, you got to seal them
No matter what you try, you'll never take my love from me
And if you might think that you can move me
From the beating of my heart

O you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
Ah, listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

O yes you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

You're, you're, you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
O listening to the wrong heartbeat
O you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong
