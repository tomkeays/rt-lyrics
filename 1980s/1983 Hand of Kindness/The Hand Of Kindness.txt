Well I wove the rope and I picked the spot
Well I struck out my neck and I tightened the knot
O stranger, stranger, I'm near out of time
You stretch out your hand, I stretched out mine

O maybe just the hand of kindness
Maybe just the hand of kindness
Maybe just a hand, stranger will you reach me in time
In time

Well I scuppered the ship and I bent the rail
Well, I cut the brakes and I ripped the sail
And they called me a Jonah, it's a sin I survived
Well, you stretched out your hand, I stretched out mine

Maybe just the hand of kindness
Well, maybe just the hand of kindness
O maybe just a hand, stranger will you reach me in time
In time

O shoot that old horse and break in the new
O the hung are many and the living are few
I see your intention, here's my neck on the line
You stretch out your hand I stretched out mine

Well, maybe just the hand of kindness
O maybe just the hand of kindness
Well, maybe just a hand, stranger will you reach me in time
In time

O maybe just the hand of kindness
Well, maybe just the hand of kindness
Well, maybe just a hand, stranger will you reach me in time
In time
