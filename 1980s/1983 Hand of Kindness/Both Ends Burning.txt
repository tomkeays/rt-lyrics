Both Ends Burning

Well I bought me a horse with a broken leg
They said that she never could win
Only fit for a bullet, they said
She'll be coming out of a tin

So I took her home, I fed her on hay
I tied her up with a sling
Well, she just kept howling all of the night
And that's the reason I sing

Well, Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
That's how she got her name
Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
I never will sleep again

Ah, Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
That's how she got her name
Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
I never will sleep again

I took her to the race-track one fine day
They couldn't believe their eyes
They said, if that nag even stays on her feet
We're going to give you first prize

Ah, Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
That's how she got her name
Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
I never will sleep again

O Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
That's how she got her name
Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
I never will sleep again

She ran so fast that it took my breath
You never did see such a win
But when she crossed that finishing line
I was just too tired to grin

Ah, Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
That's how she got her name
Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
I never will sleep again

O Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
That's how she got her name
Both Ends Burning, Both Ends Burning
I never will sleep again
