I ride with the Killerman Gold Posse
And we rob from the rich and we give to the poor
And the poor are we, and the poor are we
And we are so poor, and we want some more
And it's just another, just another, just another, just another,
Just another, just another, just another, just another day

We steal your watches and we steal your rings
And we steal your money and we steal your gold
And we ride on a train like old Jesse James
In the days of old, in the days of old
And it's just another, just another, just another, just another,
Just another, just another, just another, just another day

We are children, please don't take our freedom away
We are children, please don't take our freedom away
We are children, please don't take our freedom away
And it's just another, just another, just another

I ride with the Killerman Gold Posse
And we rob from the rich and we give to the poor
And I got a knife and he's got a knife
And it's trouble and strife and it's run for your life
And it's just another, just another, just another, just another,
Just another, just another, just another, just another,
Just another, just another, just another, just another,
Just another, just another, just another, just another day
