A Blind Step Away
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Live, Love, Larf & Loaf   (1987)

They bind his eyes with a silken scarf
And in his ear a friend explains
The one you catch is the one you kiss
How we all love party games

All the years that she has watched him
Is this the day, oh is this the day?
How she shakes as he approaches
A blind step away

He never knew how much she loved him
Standing there a step away
His eyes tied--blind man's bluff--
A blind step away

He was always reaching, reaching
Never knew where comfort lay
He never knew how much she loved him
A blind step away

Around he spins and around he spins
Darkness is his whole domain
Truth, dare, kiss, promise
Aren't you tired of party games?

He never knew how much she loved him
Standing there a step away
His eyes tied--blind man's bluff--
A blind step away
