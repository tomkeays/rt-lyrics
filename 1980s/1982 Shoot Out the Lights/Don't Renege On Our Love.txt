Remember when we were hand in hand
Remember we sealed it with a golden band
Now your eyes don't meet mine, you've got a pulse like fever
Do I take you for a lover or just a deceiver?
Simple is simple and plain is plain
If you leave me now you won't come back again
When the game is up, ah don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love
Ah no, don't renege on our love, don't renege on our love

Well give me just an ounce of sympathy
Give me my chains of liberty
There's a rope that binds us and I don't want to break it
If love is a healing why should we forsake it
Well hunger is hunger and need is need
Am I just another mouth to feed
When the game is up, well don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love, don't renege on our love

When my heart breaks it breaks like the weather
If you leave me now it'll thunder forever
Oh, don't give it up. Well, well, don't renege on our love
Ah no, don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love, don't renege on our love
Don't renege on our love
