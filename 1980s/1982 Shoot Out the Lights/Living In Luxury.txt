Living In Luxury
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Shoot Out the Lights   (1982)

I don't have no credit
And I don't know where to get it
I don't know where to get it
And it's all the same to me

You don't miss your shilling
When you got someone who's willing
Because loving is living in luxury

Rocks in my bed and two crusts of bread
Two crusts of bread ain't the feast it used to be
Rocks in my head but I've got love instead
Because loving is living in luxury

You don't look so clever
When you put it all together
You put it all together
And there ain't much to see

You don't need a thing
To live just like a king
Because loving is living in luxury
Loving is living in luxury
Loving is living in luxury
