She was there one minute and then she was gone the next
Lying in a pool of herself with a twisted neck

Oh she fell from the roof to the ground
There was glass lying all around
She was broken in a hundred pieces
When her body was found

She used to live life, she used to live life with a vengeance
And the chosen would dance, the chosen would dance in attendance

She crossed a lot of people
Some she called friends
She thought she'd live forever
But forever always ends

Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed

Oh she used to have style, she used to have style and she used it
And they say it turned bad when the truth came `round and she refused it

They found some fingerprints
Right around her throat
They didn't find no killer
And they didn't find no note

Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed

Oh did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed
