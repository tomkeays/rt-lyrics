Hey come and make it easy
Hey come and make it back
It's no use to be free
If lies are all the truth they see
They'll screw up what you do
When you're through

Hey come and make it easy
Hey come and make it back
If you need a friend
And you need a way to lose the end
You know a place for you
When you're through

Hey come and make it easy
Hey come and make it back
It's no use to be free
If lies are all the truth they see
They'll screw up what you do
When you're through
