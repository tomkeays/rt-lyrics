The Lobster
Written by George Painter/Ashley Hutchings/Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Fairport Convention-FC   (1968)

Like a lobster I can swim
And can grow another limb
Where a powerless stump you saw
I have grown a powerful claw

Where you thought me safely drowned
In the depths I swim around
Thither when you too descend
With my claw I'll tear you friend
