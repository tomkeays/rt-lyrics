She doesn't see the day today
No colours where the children play
She doesn't see the things she saw
White crosses painted on the door

See me fly, see me cry, see me walk away
Every time the sun shines, to me it's a rainy day

He didn't see the summer go
Though he knew what the shadows know
He didn't see his arms grow old
He didn't feel his blood run cold

See me fly, see me cry, see me walk away
Every time the sun shines, to me it's a rainy day

They listened to his voice grow pale
No stamps were on the morning mail
They all listened to the white truck ring
Words just didn't mean a thing

See me fly, see me cry, see me walk away
Every time the sun shines, to me it's a rainy day
