O here we are just you and me
The folks have gone to bed
Cat’s put out, the fire’s stoked up
And the fish have all been fed
There’s no one to disturb us
So put down your coffee mug
Let’s get to work, come over here
And join me on the rug

And we can do that thing, do that thing, do it all night long
If you feel good, you know it can’t be wrong

O George you are demanding
And you always get your way
But I really don’t feel up to it
I’ve had a lousy day
The office was exhausting
My boss is such a creep
You know I’d love to, really
But now I need some sleep

So we can do that thing, do that thing, do it all night long
If you feel good, you know it can’t be wrong

O won’t you come on Ethel
Where’s your sense
Of the gay, abandoned fun
Don’t get uptight
The time is right
And the evening’s just begun
Well you know the fun that we had last night
You said it was a groove
Let’s get to work down here right now
‘Cause I’m feeling in the mood

To just do that thing, do that thing, do it all night long
If you feel good, you know it can’t be wrong

O your fingers may be aching
My bones feel that way too
Control yourself a little
And slow down you wild one you
My father wouldn’t like me to
So I’m showing you the door
I’ll see you George tomorrow
And we’ll limbo dance some more

Do that thing, do that thing, do it all night long
If you feel good, you know it can’t be wrong
If you feel good, you know it can’t be wrong
