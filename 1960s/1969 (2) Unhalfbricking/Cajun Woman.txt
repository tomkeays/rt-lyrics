The baby that the preacher gave you in the Spring
Spent the winter with his finger in the undertaker's ring

Oh Cajun woman, some people still call you a queen
I don't believe you're sinking but look at all the trouble you've been

He grew up in the bayou with a bible 'round his neck
He never loved a woman the way you would expect

Oh Cajun woman, some people still call you a queen
I don't believe you're sinking but look at all the trouble you've been

Don't tell him 'bout his Father, don't tell him 'bout his name
The Gods won't get to Heaven if you crucify his brain

Oh Cajun woman, some people still call you a queen
I don't believe you're sinking but look at all the trouble you've been

Well it's welcome to the graveyard and welcome to the throne
Welcome to the orphanage where your family sit and moan
Welcome to the liquor stile and welcome to the poor
Your momma never told you how lucky you are

Oh Cajun woman, some people still call you a queen
I don't believe you're sinking but look at all the trouble you've been
