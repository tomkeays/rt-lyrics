The Ghost Of You Walks
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	you? me? us?   (1996)
Action Packed   (2001)

If that was our goodbye kiss
Seems a habit too good to miss
Once more for the memory
Hit the heights too well that time
To leave it there would be a crime
Seems more like beginning to me

At least we tried, took the biggest bite
Least we did it right
With all our soulds and all our might

Blue murder on the dance floor
French kisses in the rain
Blood wedding in the water
Till I see you again
Dutch courage is the game
And the ghost of you walks, the ghost of you walks
The ghost of you walks

The ghost of you walks right through my head
Sleepwalks at the foot of my bed
Sends old shivers over my skin
Love like that, won't let go
It's got some kind of a mind of its own
I can't break out and I can't break in

At least we lived, took it all at a rush
At least we loved too much
Felt too much, cared too much

Blue murder on the dance floor
French kisses in the rain
Blood wedding in the water
Till I see you again
Dutch courage is the game
And the ghost of you walks, the ghost of you walks
The ghost of you walks
