Business On You
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	you? me? us?   (1996)

I got sinister things waiting for you in my rattle bag
Egyptian rings, and the dust of kings, and the tooth of a hag
The bones of Keats, the tongues of cheats, and a mad dog's eye
And I'm going to make you love me and you won't know why

I've got all the magic I need, all the magic I need
I've got all the magic I need
I'm going to do the business on you
I'm going to do the business on you
I'm going to do the business on you
I've got all the magic I need

I've got a drop of Elvis' sweat from Caesar's Palace
I've got Virginia McKenna's tears from A Town Like Alice
I've got a hair from the underwear of the Empress Josephine
And I'm going to come for you, darling, in the middle of a dream

I've got all the magic I need, I've got all the magic I need
I've got all the magic I need
I'm going to do the business on you
I'm going to do the business on you
I'm going to do the business on you
I've got all the magic I need

I've got war paints, the skulls of saints, don't you want to see 'em
The blood of popes, and Tyburn ropes from the Black Museum
I've got Frederick Delius' finger, Wordsworth's tattoo
And I'm going to love you with everything, and I think you're going to love me too

I've got all the magic I need, all the magic I need
I've got all the magic I need
I'm going to do the business on you
I'm going to do the business on you
I'm going to do the business on you
I've got all the magic I need
