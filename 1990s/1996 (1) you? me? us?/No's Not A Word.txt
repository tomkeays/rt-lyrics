No's Not A Word
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	you? me? us?   (1996)

I'm going to pretend you like me too
All of my messages come from you
If I keep it up it might even drive you crazy
I'm going to pretend you're my squeeze
Arm in arm on the Champs Elysee
If I keep it up it's the only thing might save me

All of my life is a ritual dance, a ritual dance around you
And the worship hurts to pieces
Touch me here, touch me here on the precious jewel
I wear in my head for you
That only your hand releases

Let me steal your thunder, won't you
Let me be your boy wonder, won't you
Let me thrill you, will you, won't you
And no's not a word we use around here
No's not a word we use around here
No's not a word we use around here

I'm going to pretend you're head over heels
Sending me flowers, cooking me meals
If I keep it up it might even drive you crazy
I'm going to pretend we don't even sleep
Bending the bedsprings, dogs on heat
If I keep it up it's the only thing that might save me

You don't need me creeping around, creeping around your door
Like a lovesick labrador
You don't need a bird-brain from the bottom of the food chain
At the Rory O'More
But it's what you'll get for sure

Oh let me steal your thunder, won't you
Let me be your boy wonder, won't you
Let me thrill you, will you, won't you
And no's not a word we use around here
No's not a word we use around here
No's not a word we use around here
Oh no's not a word we use around here
No's not a word we use around here
No's not a word we use around here
I said no's not a word
No's not a word
No's not a word
