Dark Hand Over My Heart
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	you? me? us?   (1996)

Becky loved me and I let her
Wish I could have loved her better
On the day we pulled apart
She primed a time-bomb in my heart
Now there's a shadow hiding
Now there's a horseman riding
Lover of all broken things
Standing waiting in the wings

Sometimes I wonder why I love and let it die
Can't give, can't live just to hold back, hold back

There's a dark hand, there's a dark hand
There's a dark hand over my heart

There's a dark hand, there's a dark hand
There's a dark hand over my heart

You call me fraud and faker
You call me user, taker
You say I throw you scraps
Prove my strength by holding back
But I shine my honour brightly
Swear my allegiance nightly
But through my hands it slips
The same old demons paint their lips

Sometimes I wonder why I love and let it die
I can't give, I can't live just to hold back, hold back

There's a dark hand, there's a dark hand
There's a dark hand over my heart

There's a dark hand, there's a dark hand
There's a dark hand over my heart

There's a dark hand, there's a dark hand
There's a dark hand over my heart

Oh there's a dark hand, there's a dark hand
There's a dark hand over my heart
