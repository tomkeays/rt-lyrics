Am I Wasting My Love On You?
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	you? me? us?   (1996)

Oh I can't get started, and I'm broken hearted
You smile so sweet but you're fast on your feet
Do you want me to catch you, or just get near?
Should I chase you forever? I think I got the idea

Am I wasting my love on you?
Am I wasting my love on you?
Am I wasting my love on you?
Must be better things I can do

Oh I went to a party, you were standing there
You looked so retiring with that fruit in your hair
I said "What gives?" and you said "I do"
And that was the last sense I ever got from you

Am I wasting my love on you?
Am I wasting my love on you?
Am I wasting my love on you?
Must be better things I can do

Well I'm wasting my love, wasting my love, wasting my love on you
Wasting my love, wasting my love, wasting my love on you

Am I wasting my love on you?
Am I wasting my love on you?
Am I wasting my love on you?
Must be better things I can do

I went to your house, and I drank your tea
We were getting very cosy on Greek philosophy
You chewed on my ear and when I begged for more
You went off to bed, barricaded the door

Am I wasting my love on you?
Am I wasting my love on you?
Am I wasting my love on you?
Must be better things I can do
Than wasting my love, wasting my love, wasting my love on you
Am I wasting my love, wasting my love, wasting my love on you
I'm wasting my love, wasting my love, wasting my love on you
Am I wasting my love, wasting my love, wasting my love on you
