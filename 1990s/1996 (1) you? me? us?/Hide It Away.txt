Hide It Away

I sigh when people pass by and I hide it away
I wipe a tear from my eye and I hide it away
When I need you the most
I hold the ghost of you inside
So I keep the flame, and go on my way
Laugh at the game and I hide it away
Hide it away
Hide it away

I break down in the street and I hide it away
Can't speak, can't move my feet and I hide it away
I smile through the mask of my face
But deep and wide is the hurt inside
So I live to love some other day
Laugh at the game and I hide it away
Hide it away
Hide it away

When I need you the most
I hold the ghost of you inside
So I keep the flame, and go on my way
Laugh at the game and I hide it away
Hide it away
Hide it away
Hide it away
