The Way That It Shows

You're going to give yourself away, one of these nights
Your gaze of compassion, just a little too right
Your hug of encouragement's a little too tight
And then he'll know. It's the little things betray

Going to give yourself away, to some Casanova
On the spills and stains of the backstage sofa
He'll catch you yawning with one leg over
And there's the sin. Must be the enemy within

And that's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
The way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
A slip of the tongue, a squeeze of the hand
The way that it shows

There's glycerine in the tear, rouge in the blush
You're artful stammer a little too rushed
All passion to the eye, all cold to the touch
And then he'll guess. Your mind has drifted in the kiss

There's a chink in your armour, a crack in your defenses
Your iron will gives way to your senses
Your whispered sweet nothings all sound like expenses
And that's enough. He won't believe your words of love

And that's the way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
Yes that's the way that it shows
The way that it shows
That's the way that it shows
That's the, that's the way that it shows
A slip of the tongue, a squeeze of the hand
That's the way that it shows
