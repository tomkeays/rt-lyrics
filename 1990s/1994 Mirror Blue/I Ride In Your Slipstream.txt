I Ride In Your Slipstream

I ride in your slipstream. I wear your reflection
I echo your heartbeat in the wind

You might say that we're lovers. You might say that we're strangers
You think you don't know me, but you're wearing my ring

Good dream. Bad dream. Just don't mean a thing
Good road. Bad road. Just don't mean a thing
But down in the whine of the wheels you'll hear me sing

I'm like a TV eye in the sky, but I'm right behind you
I'm like your signed confession, but I'm right behind you
I'm like the child you never were, but I'm right behind you
Let's ride

I ride in your slipstream. Don't try to touch me
Just trust me to love you. I love you

I ride in your slipstream.
I ride in your slipstream.
I ride in your slipstream.
