Jack-knife with a precious load spills its guts all over the road
Excuse me, I had to smile, lost my grip, too, for a while
It's easy there, steady now, easy there, steady now

She didn't have the decency to sweep away what's left of me
I don't have the presence of mind to walk along on a straight line
Easy there, steady now, easy there, steady now

I call your name, I call it loud
I see your face in every crowd

Nosebleed down the bathroom wall leaves a pool down in the stall
I wonder where you are tonight, red dress, skin so white
Easy there, steady now, easy there, steady now

3 am an empty town, Doctor Marten's echo down
Old man heartbreak follows you, corruption's shadow swallows you
I said easy there, steady now, easy there, steady now

I call your name, I call it loud
I see your face in every crowd

Jack-knife with a precious load spills its guts all over the road
Excuse me, I had to smile, lost my grip, too, for a while
Easy there, steady now, easy there, steady now
Easy there, steady now, easy there, steady now
