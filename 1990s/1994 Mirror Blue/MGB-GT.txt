Oh I've got a little car and she might go far
She's the mistress of my heart now
She's a '65 with an overdrive
And I fixed her in every part now
Two in the front and two in the back
110 on the old Hog's Back
My MGB-GT, she's a runner now
MGB-GT
Oh my MGB-GT, she's a runner now

Oh I welded the sills and the old floor pan
Cut the rust with the torch and the hacksaw
Took the Rostyles off, put the spoked wheels on
Got a brand new Salisbury axle
When I come to town the girls all smile
They say "Here's the man with the retro style"
My MGB-GT, she's a runner now
MGB-GT
Oh my MGB-GT, she's a runner now

Lockheed discs and twin SUs
Original chrome on the grille now
She looks like a dream in her racing green
Competition's standing still now
I sprayed up her body, I strenghtened the frame
I stripped her right down and I built her up again

Now an Alpine's fine if you've got the time
And a Healey'll set you back some
And a TR4 costs a little bit more
But it don't have the same attraction
Hard top handy, in case of the weather
I don't care if it rains forever
In my MGB-GT, she's a runner now
MGB-GT
In my MGB-GT, she's a runner now
MGB-GT
In my MGB-GT, she's a runner now
