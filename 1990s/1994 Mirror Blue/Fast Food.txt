Fast Food
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Mirror Blue   (1994)

Small Mac, Big Mac, burger and fries
Shove `em in boxes all the same size
Easy on the mustard, heavy on the sauce
Double for the fat boy, he eats like a horse

Fry them patties and send 'em right through
Microwave oven gonna fry me too
Can't lose my job by getting in a rage
I've gotta get my hands on a minimum wage

Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Gotta make it fast, it's a fast food restaurant.

Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Gotta make it fast, it's a fast food restaurant.

Shake full of plastic, meat full of worms
Everything's zapped so you won't get germs
Water down the ketchup, easier to pour on
Pictures on the register in case you're a moron

Keep the uniform clean and don't talk back
Blood on the shirt gonna get you the sack
Sugar, grease, fats and starches
Fine to dine at the golden arches

Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Gotta make it fast, it's a fast food restaurant.

Baby throwing up in booth number nine
Wash it down and hose it down, it happens all the time
Cigarettes in the coffee, contact lens in the tea
I'd rather feed pigs than humanity.

Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Gotta make it fast, it's a fast food restaurant.

Shove it in their faces, give 'em what they want
Gotta make it fast, it's a fast food restaurant.
