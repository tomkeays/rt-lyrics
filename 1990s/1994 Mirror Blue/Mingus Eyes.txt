What a fool I was. What a thin disguise.
Brando mumble, Mingus eyes

Was a time she fell, but then she got wise
Brando mumble, Mingus eyes

I never had the squint of James Dean, or the Stanislavsky tears
Or the rebel hunch that kills, or the smile that slowly disappears

What a fool I was. What a thin disguise.
Brando mumble, Mingus eyes
Brando mumble, Mingus eyes
