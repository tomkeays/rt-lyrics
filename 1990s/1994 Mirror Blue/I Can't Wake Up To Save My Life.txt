In my nightmare everything's wrong
I'm waiting for love, but you come along
You smile, you wave, you kiss me, Ciao
But you seem too happy to see me somehow
Then the sky falls in on my head
Your nails grow long, your eyes turn red
You say "Forever, dear, and a day"
You swear that you're never going to go away
And my feet won't move to run the other way

And I can't wake up to save my life
Oh I can't wake up to save my life

In my nightmare you forgive me
The cruellest gift you could ever give me
You say that you understand me now
But your eyes say "Brother, I'll get you somehow"
And then the lightning streaks across the room
You smell like something fresh from the tomb
You squeeze too hard, you insist on kissing
When it seems like half your face is missing
And you hair's turned into reptiles hissing

And I can't wake up to save my life
Oh I can't wake up to save my life

Things I done make my dreams go bad
Like Borstal boys coming home to dad
What you reap so shall you sow
Now feets don't fail me, go man go

'Cause I can't wake up to save my life
Oh I can't wake up to save my life
No I can't wake up
No I can't wake up
Oh I can't
