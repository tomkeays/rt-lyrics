We were walking down the street, we were trying to pretend
We were wild, wild boys on a wild weekend
We were down in the dumps and we didn't have to try hard
Our old town was just like a graveyard

We come around a corner and what do we hear
Oh rock and roll music coming loud and clear
The joint is jumping, no hesitation
We're all giving ourselves free invitation

Ah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party
You gotta put up a fight on a Saturday night
So we crashed the party

There was Monks and Eddie, and Weasel and Freddy
There was the gang of four, we beat down the door
Oh we crashed the party

The fence was electric, the dogs were mean
It was just like Stalag 17
When we rung on the bell they come for the business
So we got while the getting was good

Yeah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party
You gotta put up a fight on a Saturday night
So we crashed the party

Oh, we crashed the party, yeah, we crashed the party
It would have been a sin if we didn't get in
So we crashed the party

We did the alligator and the mashed potato
Oh, we cracked some heads and broke some hearts
Oh we crashed the party

We got in the cellar, or just about
We got right in but we couldn't get out
Weasel got stuck in the bathroom window
And pushing didn't do any good

Yeah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party
You gotta put up a fight on a Saturday night
So we crashed the party

Well we got on the roof of the house next door
Jumped down twenty nine feet to the floor
Landed in the arms of an amazon queen
Dancing with her Johnny Be Good

Yeah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party
You gotta put up a fight on a Saturday night
So we crashed the party
You gotta put up a fight on a Saturday night
So we crashed the party
Hey, you gotta put up a fight on a Saturday night
So we crashed the party
