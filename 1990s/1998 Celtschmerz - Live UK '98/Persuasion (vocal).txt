You and I, tempted by the promise of a different life
Time has fled, there's a constant battle running through my head
I don't know what to do...'cos I still believe
After all the foolish things you put me through
I could always make a start on something new
And I've alway been a man who's open to
Persuasion

Blind romance, there'll be no half measures given half a chance
But we never learn, trusting in the fire while the cruel flame burns
And we need to rebuild what was never there
What got left behind
After all the foolish things that we've been through
I could always make a start on something new
And I'll always be a man who's open to
Persuasion

And it's written in my heart so that everybody can see it
And it's written in my soul, after all I still believe it
I still believe it
I still believe it
I still believe it
I still believe it

I don't know what to do...'cos I still believe
After all the foolish things you put me through
I could always make a start on something new
And I'll always be a man who's open to
Persuasion - Persuasion
