Backlash Love Affair
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Rumor and Sigh   (1991)

An iron maiden stole my heart away, O black day
Her siren songs seemed to call to me, O destiny
She spat her thrash metal lyrics right into my mind
The stage thundered and the smoke bombs made me blind
She sang "Hello liebchen, wollen-sie ein jig-a-jig-a, nein?"

She said "Left, right, right, left. Come on Joe don't be slow.
Up, down, down, up. Come on Joe, time to go.
In, out, out, in. Do it if you love me Joe"
I know it's art for art's sake but how much more can I take?
What's my share of this backlash love affair?

Her hair extension's down to her knees, what a tease
She got tattoos everywhere you look, she's a comic book
Why she goes for my type I'll never understand
She's so demure when we promenade hand in hand
And when we get back home she let's me know that she's in command

She said "Left, right, right, left. Come on Joe don't be slow.
Up, down, down, up. Come on Joe, it's time to go.
In, out, out, in. Do it if you love me Joe"
I know it's art for art's sake but how much more can I take?
What's my share of this backlash love affair?

Those iron maidens, cool as a marble slab
They wrap around you and the cold knives cut and stab
I can't live my life as someone else's shishkebab

She said "Left, right, right, left. Come on Joe don't be slow.
Up, down, down, up. Come on Joe, it's time to go.
In, out, out, in. Do it if you love me Joe"
I know it's art for art's sake but how much more can I take?
What's my share of this backlash love affair?
