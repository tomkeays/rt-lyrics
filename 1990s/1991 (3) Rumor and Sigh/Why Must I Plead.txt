Why Must I Plead

All your bitterness and lies
Sting like tears in my eyes
And a thousand love-sick tunes
Won't wash away the wounds from my mind
You've been seen around, you're a new sensation
You got a better deal, and you took his invitation
You've been sitting on his lap and taking his dictation

Oh but mercy, we used to love all day and drive all night
Oh mercy, jealousy used to whet your appetite
Oh mercy, we were low as dogs and high as kites
Why must I plead with you darling
Why must I plead with you darling
Why must I plead with you darling
For what's already mine

Well my friends are indiscreet
And I sing myself to sleep
I don't mind the red wine
Or the pick-up line as long as it's cheap
Oh I ask you what's what and you say I'm all yours
I ask who your friend is and you say it's Santa Claus
I ask you to come home, you say you're tired of being indoors

Oh but mercy, you know you signed on that dotted line
Oh mercy, you signed yours and I signed mine
Oh mercy, you said forever till the end of time
Oh why must I plead with you darling
Why must I plead with you darling
Oh why must I plead with you darling
For what's already mine
I said why must I plead with you darling
For what's already mine
