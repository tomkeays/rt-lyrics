You Dream Too Much
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Rumor and Sigh   (1991)

She came down the stairs in her cocktail dress
She fell on her food like a lioness
There was ringing in my ears like an SOS
She said "You dream too much.
If you think I've a thing for you.
You dream too much. It's going to end bad"

The boom box was sounding sweet
We were dancing to a jungle beat
Just when our lips were about to meet
She said "You dream too much.
Ah who's that girl in your dreams with you?
You dream too much. It's going to end bad"

You'll stumble going through life the way that you do
I hope I'm somewhere else the day that you do
The way that you do

She had a chassis like an XJS
A skull necklace like a high priestess
I thought maybe just one caress
She said "You dream too much.
You're dreaming now while I'm talking to you.
You dream too much. It's going to end bad. Oh it's going to end bad"

All my life I've been like this
I start thinking of the perfect kiss
Velvet dream on an iron fist
She said "You dream too much.
Even this isn't really true.
You dream too much. It's going to end bad. Oh it's going to end bad.
Ah it's going to end bad. It's going to end bad"
