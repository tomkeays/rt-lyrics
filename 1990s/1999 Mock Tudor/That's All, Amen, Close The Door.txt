That's All, Amen, Close The Door

That's all. That's all there was.
Say Amen. Close the door.
She gave as much as she had to give
Please don't ask for more
Please don't ask for more
That's all. The curtain's down.
The lights are up. Go home.
Did I care?
Was I in love?
In love enough to know
In love enough to know

There's precious few that line that road
She welled from deep and overflowed
There's no cup to hold the past
Too rich to drink, too rich to last
That's all

Well, you wish
But don't wish for me
As if a wish
Could cheat the fall
Oh just believe
And leave it be
There's beauty in what's brief
There's beauty in what's small
That's all

There's some who dare and some who shine
And some who only drag behind
And some who reap what others sow
When memories fail well who's to know

That's all. That's all there was.
Say Amen. Close the door.
She gave as much as she had to give
Oh please don't ask for more
Please don't ask for more
That's all.
