Peppermint rock with your name right through it all

Suck it all day and it might go away
Kiss me quick, cowboy, helter skelter
Trampoline on the beach all day

She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
The peppermint rock, need to remember
The peppermint rock, need to forget
Peppermint rock with your name right through it
The peppermint rock, the peppermint rock, the peppermint rock
Ooh she got that look in her eyes,
She got that look in her eyes
She got that look in her eyes

Peppermint rock and a sticky, sticky chip bag
Love is a zip and a fumble away
Cold, cold hands and teenage tipsy
Ocean, wash my sins away

She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
The peppermint rock, need to remember
The peppermint rock, need to forget
Peppermint rock with your name right through it
The peppermint rock, the peppermint rock, the peppermint rock
Ooh she got the lie of the land
She got the lie of the land
She got the lie of the land

She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
The peppermint rock, need to remember
The peppermint rock, need to forget
Peppermint rock with your name right through it
The peppermint rock, the peppermint rock, the peppermint rock
Ooh she got that look in her eyes,
She got that look in her eyes
She got that look in her eyes

The peppermint rock
