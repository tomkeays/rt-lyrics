All of my life I feed the big chimney
Coke and ore, I pour it in
Food for the hungry mouth of the monster
Got to keep the production rolling

Black ore, brown ore and Santander
Pour that Blue Billy onto the bell
Eighteen hundredweight on the barrow
Lift that ore and push like hell

Pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron

Drive the steel bar into the taphole
Pour the metal down into the sows
Blasted one side, frozen the other side
Rain and snow and sleet and blow

Taller than the church's steeple
Forever the big chimney owns my soul
I'm midwife to a pig of iron
Born of flame and sweat and coal

Pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron

All of my life I feed the big chimney
Coke and ore, I pour it in
Food for the hungry mouth of the monster
Got to keep the production rolling

Pig iron, pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
Making pig iron, pig iron, pig iron, pig iron, pig iron
