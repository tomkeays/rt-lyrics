False Or True
Written by Richard Thompson/Peter Filleul
Appears on  	Sweet Talker   (1991)

I tell you secrets that don't even matter
I give you keepsakes but only to flatter
I don't believe in myself, I don't believe in myself
So why should anyone else

Will I be a thief for love
Soon or never, ever false or true

New tricks for old dogs, no sleight, no deceiving
I wish I were someone that you could believe in
I don't believe in myself, oh I don't believe in myself
So why should anyone else

Will I be a thief for love
Soon or never, ever false or true
False or true
