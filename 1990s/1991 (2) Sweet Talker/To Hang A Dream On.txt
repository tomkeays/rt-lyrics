To Hang A Dream On
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Sweet Talker   (1991)

Someone knocking at your front door
Could be the one you're looking for
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

I might be the one, I just might be
You might be waiting for the likes of me
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

Romance is a peach, you can't resist her
Even if you try, don't forget it mister
She'll get under you skin
And you won't care why

Santa Claus or Captain Cook
Everyone looking for the same old hook
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

This is my life, my whole career
Selling my soul for a good idea
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

This old town's been down so long
Looks to me like it needs someone
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

Romance is a peach, you can't resist her
Even if you try, don't forget it mister
She'll get under you skin
And you won't care why

Someone knocking at your front door
Could be the one you're looking for
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on
