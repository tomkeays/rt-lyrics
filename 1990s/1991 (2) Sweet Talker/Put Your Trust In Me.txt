Put Your Trust In Me
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Sweet Talker   (1991)

Oh my hand shakes steady and my words are sweet
And the whole world's lying here at my feet
Put your trust in me, put your trust in me

I rub my eyes and I catch my breath
I'm almost choking on the smell of success
Put your trust in me, put your trust in me

I get careless now and then
But I won't let you down again

I got x-ray eyes and with just one look
I can read your future like an open book
Put your trust in me, put your trust in me

I get careless now and then
But I won't let you down again

Oh my hand shakes steady and my words are sweet
And the whole world's lying here at my feet
Put your trust in me, put your trust in me

Put your trust in me

Put your trust in me
