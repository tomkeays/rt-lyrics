Don't Take It Laying Down
Written by Richard Thompson

There's a time for peace and love
There's a time to just survive
If I hadn't raised my head
You would have buried me alive

Don't take it lying down
Give them as good as they gave you
Don't take it lying down
That turn the cheek stuff won't save you now

If I speak who's going to hear?
I'm drowned out with the tide
Love to hear your point of view
Could there be another side?

We can't pick without a choice
We can't drink without a well
When you though you'd stopped our voice
You woke the sleeping lion as well
