She Never Could Resist A Winding Road
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Still 2015

In the old cold embers of the year
When joy and comfort disappear
I search around to find her
I'm a hundred miles behind her
The open road whispered in her ear

She never could resist a winding road
She never could resist a winding road
Maybe just around the bend
The rainbow waiting at the end
She never could resist a winding road

She never could stay any place too long
To not be standing still's where she belongs
If you love her, better know
She needs you now, but soon she'll go
She never could stay any place too long

It's not that she don't care about you
Say you love her, she don't doubt you
But she can learn to live without you
When she hears the call

Love her now then let her be
Don't tie her down, just set her free
Too many things she wants to see
The whole world, that's all

She never could resist a winding road
She never could resist a winding road
Maybe just around the bend
The rainbow waiting at the end
She never could resist a winding road
She never could resist a winding road
