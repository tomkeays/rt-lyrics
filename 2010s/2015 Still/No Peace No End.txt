No Peace No End
Written by Richard Thompson

Where were you when the walls were crumbling
Where were you when the guns were rumbling
Where were you when the hounds of hell
Took sons and lovers away
Did you see me on the slippery slope
Wrong end of a telescope
Do you even pause for breath
As you sleepwalk through the day

Some day won't you
Stand in my shoes
And see the world I see
No hope no friend
No peace, no end

I'm ground between two stones
Soon I'll be nothing but bones
Who'll be my shining savior
Before I turn to dust?
Are you the hand that kills me?
Are you the hand that saves me?
When they both sell you down the river
Which one can you trust?

Some day won't you
Stand in my shoes
And see the world I see
No hope no friend
No peace, no end
No hope no friend
No peace, no end

In the peace museum there's a mangy dove
To remind us all of universal love
You can rent her out for your corporate dinner
And feel good about yourself
Geneva Convention they use as a pessary
Olive branch is a fashion accessory
In the big chess game there's just one winner
And it's always somebody else

Some day won't you
Stand in my shoes
And see the world I see
No hope no friend
No peace, no end
No hope no friend
No peace, no end
