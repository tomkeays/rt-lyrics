Fork In The Road

That Esperanto lullaby is keeping me in stitches
I don't know what she's saying but the sound of it bewitches
But it's over my head
She thinks she's queen for a day, hooray!

Which way, passion or poison
Which way, get the highway code
All questions, no answers
Standing here at a fork in the road
A fork in the road

Eglantine, she takes her time, she takes good aim and fires
Her crystal ball is hard to read when it's tangled in the wires
But it's over my head
She thinks she's queen for a day, hooray!

Miss Carnaby she wants to be calliope on meth
She fits the job description if she doesn't bleed to death
But it's over my head
She thinks she's queen for a day, hooray!
