Broken Doll
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Still 2015

You called for me so here I am
Not a boy and not a man
Man enough to know the odds are long
They dress you up and keep you clean
Like courtiers around a queen
Show you good from bad, right from wrong

All the tears in the world
All the tears in the world
Won't mend a broken doll

The little things in life escape her
Dolls are made of rags and paper
China cracks and chips so easily
Doesn't have the will, the strength
To hold the world out at arm's length
Skin's too thin, eyes too wide to see

All the tears in the world
All the tears in the world
Won't mend a broken doll

Wish I could give love to you
And life to you and hope to you
As you look through me to something else
In your face I think I see
Twisted-up infinity
Angel soul imprisoned in a shell

All the tears in the world
All the tears in the world
Won't mend a broken doll
