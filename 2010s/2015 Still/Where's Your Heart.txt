Where's Your Heart?

Why so cool
Why so tough
You call all the shots
You strut your stuff

But where's your heart?
Where's your heart?
It should be beating right there
Where's your heart?

So strange to hear you
Talk about love
Is it just yourself
You're enamored of?

But 1here's your heart?
Where's your heart?
It should be beating right there
Where's your heart?

I wish you'd leave
But what good's wishing
You're a puzzle to me
With pieces missing
Where's your heart?

Did salt tears ever
Leave your eye
Did love ever make you
Wish and sigh?

Where's your heart?
Where's your heart?
It should be beating right there
Where's your heart?
Where's your heart?
Where's your heart?
