Long John Silver
Written by Richard Thompson

Long John Silver, he was on me like a rash
Gave him my trust, gave him my cash
Should have seen through him, should have seen from the start
There's nothing but black in pirate's heart

Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver
Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver

Long John Silver, he's good with numbers
He makes hay while other folks slumber
Gives me the brass, and he keeps all the best
The better to feather his pretty little nest

Long John Silver, Long John Silver,
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver
Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver

Took all my money, my watch and chain
Crack his head if I see him again
Kind friends, warning take by me
Not every pirate's sailing the sea

Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver
Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver
