Wounding Myself
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Still 2015

I know where you lay your head down
In the dirty back alleys in town
Feeding your head with cocaine
Whiskey and lies, lies, lies

It's like sticking a knife in my side
The way that you bottled your pride
I'm scared to see you
I'm scared to look in your eyes, eyes, eyes

Nothing makes sense about you
You friends use the past tense about you
I can't help where life shoved you
You hurt everyone who ever loved you
And now I'm just wounding myself, wounding myself

You always wanted to know
The depths to which you could go
Did you know you'd break every promise
On the way down, down, down

And the spiders that crawl in your head
Make you say the mean words that you say
It hurts to lose you, it hurts to love you
So I'll just say, see you around

What's the point in despairing
What's the point of even caring
You turned your back on everyone
Gone down like the setting sun
