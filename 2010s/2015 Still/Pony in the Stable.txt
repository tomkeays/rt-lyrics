Pony In The Stable
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Still 2015

You're messing with my mind
You're thrilling me but killing me
I'm missing all the signs
You're rushing me and crushing me
Same old same old
Packs of lies and compromises
Same old same old
Pony in the stable

You've got me where it stings
Wrapped around your little finger
Sold off all my things
Begging like a carol singer
Same old same old
Bread and dripping on the table
Same old same old
Pony in the stable

Forgive me if I sneer
You're used to being Cleopatra
You don't like to hear
The stuff you dish out come back at you
Same old same old
Packs of lies and compromises
Same old same old
Pony in the stable

I'm flattered but I'm scared
You picked me out from all the others
Should have been prepared
For friends to parlay into lovers
Same old same old
Bread and dripping on the table
Same old same old
Pony in the stable
