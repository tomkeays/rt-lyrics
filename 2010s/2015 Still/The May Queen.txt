The May Queen
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Still 2015

Didn't you see it coming, if you loved her that well?
Were you too cranked up yourself to be able to tell
She was damned, she was drifting, but what the hell
You went missing in action

You were just there to prop up the bar
Bask in the limelight from a shining star
While you served up the poison
And chauffeured the car
I hope you got job satisfaction

The May Queen, she's lying, sleeping
Crimson from her wound is weeping
An the ones who dragged her down to this
Line up, her frozen lips to kiss

Weren't you the guardian of the rose, come what may?
Didn't you see the worm that was eating her away
Were you too busy looking in the mirror to say
The carriage has turned into a pumpkin

You're out on your own, your own kind of girl
The soul of mediocrity loosed on the world
Don't be afraid, come on, give it a whirl
Adequate always counts for something

They took all her babies, it wasn't disrespect
If they died of anything, they died of neglect
Passion and experience isn't something you inject
When the game's got pieces missing
