Patty Don't You Put Me Down

Patty don't tell me one thing and change your mind
We might be in bed together but the deal's not signed
They say you collect shrunken heads, would you like to have mine?

Patty don't you put me down
Don't colour me cruel

You're so used to skimming the ace and palming the jack
The right hand giving and the left hand taking it back
At society functions they probably give you more slack

Patty don't you put me down
Don't colour me cruel

You can stamp all you want, but this ain't television
I can't fix it all with a small incision
It's a meltdown you're having, not nuclear fission
There's no room service at the seaman's mission

In your ten watt world it's beyond any pleasure you know
To stick your fingers in the socket, and give yourself a glow
Keep that up and they might make you part of the show

Patty don't you put me down
Don't colour me cruel
