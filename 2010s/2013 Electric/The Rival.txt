The Rival

Oh, I can lick you fairly, squarely
Give your head a mighty crack
Make your nose bleed down your shirt front
With one hand behind my back.

Toorah loorah, toorah loorah
Toorah loorah, toorah loorah.

I set my heart on Jeannie Wilson
She's the one I'm going to see
If you're of the same persuasion
There's no room for you and me.

Toorah loorah, toorah loorah
Toorah loorah, toorah loorah.

I love to see those stuffy airs and graces
The more pumped up, the more they tend to fall right on their faces.

You might have a few pounds on me
You might have the edge in height
But I can do a trick or two
To rattle your teeth and dim your lights.

Toorah loorah, toorah loorah
Toorah loorah, toorah loorah.

I love to see those stuffy airs and graces
The more pumped up, the more they tend to fall right on their faces.

You come from a different planet
Sexy motor, groovy tan
I fought my way up from under
I don't have no back-up plan.

Toorah loorah, toorah loorah
Toorah loorah, toorah loorah.
