Sally B, oh Sally B, you make my heart flutter
Will you drag me from the gutter, Sally B
Sally B, oh Sally B, I'm a working man truly
But you know how to woo me, Sally B
Sally B, oh Sally B, the bank's repossessing
It's hard times I'm guessing, Sally B.

You've got the style touches the people
You've got the style
You've got the style touches the people, Sally B.

Now they talk way down south without moving their mouth
And the houses are old antebellum
There you'll find supporters, revolutionary daughters
Who'll believe everything that you tell 'em.

Sally B, oh Sally B, who needs them books
When you've got them looks, Sally B
Sally B, oh Sally B, the crown of thorns suit you
You're my hope for the future, Sally B.

You've got the style touches the people
You've got the style
You've got the style touches the people, Sally B.

The crazies are raving so keep the flag waving
It still hypnotizes the masses
And how many stumpers can cause such a rumpus
With a smile and a shake of the chassis?

Sally B, oh Sally B, oh you talk so down-homey
Oh you talk like you know me, Sally B
Sally B, oh Sally B, your blue eyes are steely
But you smile so sincerely, Sally B.

Sally B, oh Sally B, with the gifts that God gave you
Will you be my savior, Sally B
Sally B, oh Sally B, you make my heart flutter
Will you drag me from the gutter, Sally B.
