All songs written by Richard Thompson

Beeswing Music (BMI) Administered by BUG Music Inc., a BMG Chrysalis Company.
Produced and Mixed by Buddy Miller.

Recorded at Buddy's House by Mike Poole
The album was recorded in Buddy Miller's home in Nashville in May 2012. Thompson took his stripped down "electric trio" band (himself, bass player Taras Prodaniuk and drummer Michael Jerome) to the sessions. Miller produced, played some rhythm guitar parts and brought in some local players to augment the trio, notably Stuart Duncan and Siobhan Maher Kennedy. The bulk of the recording was finished in two weeks, with Miller overdubbing Alison Krauss's vocal parts on "The Snow Goose" later on.
