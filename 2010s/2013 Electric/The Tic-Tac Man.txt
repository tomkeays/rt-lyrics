You can see me down your way, I'm the tic-tac man
In the distance, far away, I'm the tic-tac man
When the going's firm to good
When it's muddy underfoot
Trying to be understood, the tic-tac man.

Can't you see me waving here, I'm the tic-tac man?
Got my arms up in the air, I'm the tic-tac man n?
When the lightning's forking down
When the fog is on the ground
When the dark is all around, the tic-tac man.

Did you hear me in your dreams like the breath of night?
Rustling and whispering like the breath of night, like the breath of night?

I make signs for all to see, I'm the tic-tac man
You never seem to notice me, I'm the tic-tac man
Everyone's so far away
Marching in their own parade
Just another lonely day for the tic-tac man.

Well, I need to hold you close to me, I'm the tic-tac man
Hear you speak and feel you breathe, I'm the tic-tac man
I wasn't born to live like this
Peering through the morning mist
Dreaming of a touch, a kiss, oh the tic-tac man.
Oh, I'm the tic-tac man
I'm the tic-tac man
I'm the tic-tac man
I'm the tic-tac man
I'm the tic-tac man
I'm the tic-tac man.
