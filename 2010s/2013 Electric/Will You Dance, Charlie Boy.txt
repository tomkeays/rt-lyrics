Will You Dance, Charlie Boy?
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Electric 2013

Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?
Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?
Though the sequins are worn and tattered and torn
And the seat is right out of your pants.

Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?
Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?
One more time, Charlie boy, with your old pride and joy
Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?

Oh, you're still pretty fast on your feet
You still got the other ones beat
Though the years have gone by and the tank's running dry
You're still pretty fast on your feet.

Will you dance to the tune that they play?
Will you dance to the tune that they play?
Will you play the old game of fortune and fame?
And grin as you sign your life away?

Is there life in the old doggie yet?
Is there life in the old doggie yet?
Will you stand on your mark, on your hind legs and bar?
Like somebody's dear little pet?

Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?
Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?
Will you be a good whore for the people once more
Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?

Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?
Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?
Will you be a good whore for the people once more
Will you dance Charlie boy, will you dance?
