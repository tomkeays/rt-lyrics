Straight And Narrow
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Electric 2013

She walks the straight and narrow
She does what the Good Book says
She walks the straight and narrow
She got eyes in the back of her head, boys
Eyes in the back of her head.

And when she looks to Heaven
She's looking at you instead
When she looks to Heaven
She got eyes in the back of her head, boys
Eyes in the back of her head.

And a man's a fool to need her
A man's a fool to yearn
Giving up everything for maybe nothing in return.

She walks on clouds of glory
Her feet don't touch the dirt
She walks on clouds of glory
It'll make you tear your shirt, boys
Make you tear your shirt (tear your shirt).

A man's a fool to need her
A man's a fool to yearn
Giving up everything for maybe nothing in return.

She trips the light fantastic
But she dances all alone
Her clothes are made of plastic
But her heart is made of stone, boys
Her heart is made of stone.

Well, she walks the straight and narrow
She does what the Good Book says
She walks the straight and narrow
She got eyes in the back of her head, boys
Eyes in the back of her head.
