My Enemy
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Electric 2013

When you thought I was winning the game
You came and snuffed out the flame
You thought you finished me off but you just made me strong.

Each time you dealt me a blow
Each time you brought me so low
I found something inside to help me along.

My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy
My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy.

Did I slight you in some little way
Or does hate help you get through the day?
One way or another, I'm happy your aim was so true.

If the demons in you hadn't jarred
I would never have struggled so hard
The only thing now eating me is what's eating you.

My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy
My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy.

My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy
My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy.

Now we're just two old men on the brink
Each waiting for the other to blink
If I should lose you, I'd be left with nothing but fate.

As I see your life fall apart
I should smile but I don't have the heart
At the end of the day, it's still too much effort to hate.

My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy
My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy.
