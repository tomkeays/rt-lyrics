Good Things Happen To Bad People

Sweet thing, believe me
You'll never deceive me
You stared me down without blinking
That's when I really started thinking

You must have been running around
You must have been running around
'Cause you were smiling

Your friends say you're antsy
For something fancy
Like a caged bird that's broken free
You want to fly high and mess on me

Well, I know you've got a secret or two
Your hair's in a brand new 'do
And you're so happy

Good things happen to bad people
Good things happen to bad people
But only, but only for a while

You cried the day I walked you down the aisle
And I know you've been bad from the way you smile

Mona Lisa, what a teaser
What's that strange cologne I'm smelling?
You know more than you're telling

Well, I know you been running around
I know you been running around
'Cause you're so happy

Good things happen to bad people
Good things happen to bad people
But only, but only for a while

You cried the day I walked you down the aisle
And I know you've been bad from the way you smile

Good things happen to bad people
Good things happen to bad people
But only, but only for a while

You cried the day I walked you down the aisle
And I know you've been bad from the way you smile
