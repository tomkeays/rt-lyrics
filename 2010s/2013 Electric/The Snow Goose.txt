The Snow Goose
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Electric 2013

Northern winds will cut you
Northern girls will gut you
Leave you cold and empty
Like a fish on the slab.

Oh, she is like a snow goose
Pale and rare and footloose
Will the joys that tempt me
Soon turn and kick and stab.

In the dream I am running
Down a street of molasses
In the dream my feet gain no ground.

I must take some measure
To pursue my treasure
Guided by confusion
My compass through the storm.

If I call her sister
Manfully resist her
Believe my own illusion
Or will passions warm.

In the dream I am running
Down a street of molasses
In the dream my feet gain no ground.

If I call her lover
Will I soon discover
That her eye is taken
By some fawning friend?

Then my glass would shatter
And my mind would scatter
Being so mistaken
The world must end.

In the dream I am running
Down a street of molasses
In the dream my feet gain no ground.

In the dream I'm calling
But there's never an answer
In the dream my voice makes no sound.

Northern winds will cut you
Northern girls will gut you
Leave you cold and empty
Like a fish on the slab.
