Stuck On The Treadmill

Well, the money goes out, the bills come in
Round and round we go again
I come close but I never win
I'm stuck on the treadmill.

Another day of punching steel
Till my arm's too numb to feel
Like a hamster on a wheel
I'm stuck on the treadmill.

Wish I knew a better way to keep myself alive
Shaking sheets of metal every day from 9 to 5
Others may be living but me I just survive, me I just survive.

Machine's screaming in my ear
Wasn't I just standing here?
Went to sleep, grabbed a beer
I'm stuck on the treadmill.

Me and the robot working away
He looks at me, as if to say
'I'll be doing your job some day'
Stuck on the treadmill.

I wish I knew a better way to keep myself alive
Shaking sheets of metal every day from 9 to 5
Others may be living but me I just survive, me I just survive.

Jobs are going by the score
They're laying off a hundred more
Twenty years and they show you the door
I'm stuck on the treadmill.

Strike's coming, trouble's brewing
Whole town going to rack and ruin
Next year, what'll I be doing?
Stuck on the treadmill.
