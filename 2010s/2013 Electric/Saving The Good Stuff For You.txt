Saving The Good Stuff For You

I've seen trouble from every direction
My old head is peppered with grey
I could never resist life's temptations
Oh, they just seemed to fall in my way.

I've had wives, I treated them badly
And maybe a lover or two
All the time, oh I didn't know it
I was saving the good stuff for you.

I was saving the good stuff for you, darling
Saving the good stuff for you
There was some part of me knew, darling
To save the good stuff for you.

And I even thought on occasion
It was love that was making me blue
Oh, some kind of love, well I called it love
Maybe fatal attraction will do.

Well, I got it all out of my system
My heart it is tested and true
All the time, oh I didn't know it
I was saving the good stuff for you.

I was saving the good stuff for you, darling
Saving the good stuff for you
There was some part of me knew, darling
To save the good stuff for you.

I'm glad that you never did know me
When I was out of control
I was hollow right there in the middle
Some people got sucked in the hole.

But I cut myself loose from the old ways
And you're all that I'm clinging to
All the time, oh I didn't know it
I was saving the good stuff for you.

I was saving the good stuff for you, darling
Saving the good stuff for you
There was some part of me knew, darling
To save the good stuff for you
Oh, I'm saving the good stuff for you.
