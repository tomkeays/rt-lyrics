Where's Home?
Written by Richard Thompson

I wish this life of twists and turns would end
And I could find my way back home again
But Where's Home? Where's Home?
I've been so long away
I'll make it back some day
Where's Home?

However many roads I walk along
I never find a place where I belong
Where's Home? Where's Home?
I've got no place to be
I'm like a refugee
Where's Home?

I used to know the street
Someone changed the name
Signpost turned around
Nothing looks the same
But I belong somewhere
I belong somewhere

I stare at endless walls, pace endless floors
I lie in endless beds, slam endless doors
Where's Home? Where's Home?
Where's Home?
