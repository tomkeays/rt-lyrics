Another Small Thing In Her Favour
Written by Richard Thompson

Got her ducks all in a row
Got her bags all packed to go
She'll find some other poor pilgrim who's braver.

At least she looked me in the eye
With her less than fond goodbye
That's one small thing in her favour.

Got the kids in the car
Dreams will get you just so far
Then life gives you bitter pills to savour.

Still she kissed me once more
As she gently slammed the door
That's another small thing in her favour.

She said she felt bad
For the home that we had
And the effort I'd wasted to save her.

Oh, she told me as much
As she slowly let out the clutch
That's another small thing in her favour.

Now it's a slippery slope
To give her more rope
And I didn't exactly enslave her.

And she says I'm still apart
Of her wandering heart
That's another small thing in her favour.

Now there's trouble and strife
But we once had a life
And for a while our vows didn't waver.

I relied on her smile
And her love for a while
Well, that's another small thing in her favour.
Oh, that's another small thing in her favour.
