I'm A Dreamer
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on  	Shoot Out The Lights (expanded and remastered)   (2010)

You make me nervous when I see you
I can't imagine what it's like to be you
It's a mystery to me every day
And I've got to get away

I put a bet on with a bookie
For the race they put on over in Kentucky
It's lovely at this time of year, so they say
And I've got to get away

Chorus
I'm a dreamer, and you know
I'm a schemer with an eye for a show
It's my imagination when I get low
And the truth is I don't think I'll ever go
When the music's playing, that's when it changes
And no longer do we seen like total strangers
It's all those words which always get in the way
Of what you want to say

When I wake up in the morning
I think it only fair to give you warning
I probably won't go away
I'll more than likely stay

(Chorus)
