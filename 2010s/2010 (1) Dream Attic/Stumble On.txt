No easy way to say, it's over now
And I don't want to end it anyhow
We knew this time would come before too long
Love, how will I learn to Stumble On?

We stole a few short moments out of time
Just long enough for a little light to shine
Now the door swings closed, the dark has come
Love, how will I learn to Stumble On?

Stumble On

You taught me all the easy ways of love
You brought joy to my life and that's enough
I've learned how long the night is when you're gone
Love, how will I learn to Stumble On?

Now the scene will slowly fade to black
Whatever else you do, love don't look back
You'll only see a man whose dream is gone
Love, how will I learn to Stumble On?

Stumble On
