Out there in the desert air
Penguin meets the polar bear
Hey ho pilgrim
Light the precious flame

Burning Man light up the skies
Burning Man with flames for eyes
Hey ho pilgrim
Anarchy's the name

And I'll care for you
For a day or two
Strangers meeting in the darkness
Underneath the arch of wheels
Funny how it heals

Gather in from all around
Gather at the sacred ground
Hey ho pilgrim
Spin the wheel of sin

And give me bread
I'll give you wine
Dragon cars and silver walkers
Wear the art and build the shrine
Yours or mine

Mad Max and hulks of rust
Out there in the desert dust
Hey ho pilgrim
Without you and within
