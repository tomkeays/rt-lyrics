She spins me round
And turns me down
And I don’t know why
And I don’t know why

Did she just refuse me?
Did she just abuse me?
And I don’t know why
And I don’t know why

She’s always bugging me, hugging me
Faking me, shaking me
Haunting me, taunting me

Big Sun Falling In The River
Big sky shining in the water
Big love dying like the dying day
Big Sun Falling In The River
Big sky shining in the water
We’re done, but she don’t have the nerve to say

On the bridge of sighs
She close her eyes
And she looks away
And she looks away
As a compromise
She softly lies
And she looks away
And she looks away

The world is crashing around me and
Dashing around me and
Smashing around me

On the pleasure wheel
Pain is all I feel
And she bites her lip
