Next time I promise
I will be ready
Ready to move when the clouds roll apart
Next time I promise
I'll do it better
When the sun shines on me and pierces my heart

If Love Whispers Your Name
Breathes in your ear
Sighs in the rain
Love is worth every fall
Even to beg
Even to crawl

I won't act so cool
Won't be a fool
Next time
I won't quote the law
Won't be so sure
Next time

I once had it all and
I once lost it all and
I won't miss again
If the chance should come my way again
If love should look my way again

If Love Whispers Your Name
Breathes in your ear
Sighs in the rain
Love is worth every fall
Even to beg
Even to crawl

Love is worth every wound
Each lonely day,
Each sleepless night
Love is worth every wound
The price that you pay
To live in the light
