I love kittens and little babies
Can't you see that's the guy I am
Your money is so safe with me
You never met such an honest man
Glossies on my office wall
The rich and famous, I know them all

Come on and do the Money Shuffle
I've got you right there where I want you
Come on and do the Money Shuffle
Can't find your money if you want to
Stock market going through the roof now
So rich I'll never add it up now
I've got your savings here somewhere

Here at Warbrook and Jones it's all tradition
We never pimp and we don't hustle
If you'll just bend over a little
I think you'll feel my financial muscle
Spread it wide, wide as you can
To get the full benefit of my plan

Come on and do the Money Shuffle
I've got you right there where I want you
Come on and do the Money Shuffle
Can't find your money if you want to
My God, the market's in a free fall
I'll save my arse and skip the country
Wish the hell I knew what I was doing

This year, think I'll skip Monte
One tires of the same old social scene
With all the problems in the world today
They'll notice if my bonus is obscene
Spread it wide, wide as you can
To get the full benefit of my plan

Amended last verse and chorus:

O how sublime - it's sub prime time
One man's junk's another man's triple A
If you need a little refuge for your pension fund
Lucky you, I'll send some jewels your way
Spread it wide, wide as you can
To get the full benefit of my plan

Come on and do the Money Shuffle
I've got you right there where I want you
Come on and do the Money Shuffle
Can't find your money if you want to
I hear the sound of distant thunder
AIG and Lehmans going under
Will I get my bonus, I wonder?
