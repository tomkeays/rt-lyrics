O monsieur! O Signor!
Bravissimo! Quel Honneur!
Just to be within your orbit
To grasp each lesson and absorb it

Bring me a fleet of golden ships
To carry the jewels fallen from your lips

Just one small thing, une petite chose
I'm going to have to tweak your little nose
Haha! O dear, I'm sorry, did that hurt?
And do I see a little crimson spurt?

Malpensio, is this the best we've got?
Remove him, and let the next one have a shot
