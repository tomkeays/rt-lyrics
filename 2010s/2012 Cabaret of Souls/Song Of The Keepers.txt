(Keeper Of The Underworld)

Welcome, welcome - excuse the mess, we don't get many visitors down here - well, just dead ones, usually. Have you ever tried talking to dead people? So unrewarding. You may be wondering why you're here - you may not have noticed, but you have moved from one world into another, unknowingly, as if from one room to another room. You are, in other words, and not to put too fine a point on it, and not to beat about the bush - DEAD. We like to greet our new arrivals to the 'Underworld' with a little entertainment. Let me introduce my assistants, Grympale - Malpensio.

(Keeper, Grympale and Malpensio)

We're not exactly devils - no! no!
We're not exactly angels - no! no!
We're something in between
We're something in between
And we can be very mean - yes! yes!
Can be very very mean - yes! yes!
But we tidy and we sweep and we keep the place clean
Down here in the land of in between

There's a very hot place, O a very hot place -
I think you know the place I mean
And there's a nice cool place where breezes blow
But this is the place that's in between
This is the place that's in between

All lost souls, they end up here
Waiting for the judgment day
Dazed and dreaming of their lives
But down here everything is grey

Yes all lost souls, they end up here
Perhaps you'd like to meet one or two?
As a matter of fact -
If you'll spare the time of day -
We've a little entertainment coming your way
We've a little entertainment coming your way
Don't go away
Don't go away
Don't go away

(Keeper)

Malpensio - bring on the talent!
