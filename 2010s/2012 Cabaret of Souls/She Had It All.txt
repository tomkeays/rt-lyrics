She Had It All
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Cabaret of Souls 2012

(Keeper, Grympale, Malpensio)

She really had it all, it seems a shame (She had it all)
To win each round and then to lose the game (She had it all)
All that will, all that effort. All that fuss (She had it all)
To be run over by a thirty seven bus (She had it all)
