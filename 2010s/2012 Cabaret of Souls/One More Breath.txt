(Keeper)

It's cold down here
It's grey down here
It's bleak down here
It's sad down here

(Richard Thompson)

No touch
No taste
No smell
No light

(Judith Owen)

One more breath, one more breath
What would I give for one more breath

(Debra Dobkin)

Trade - my - soul - for - one - more - breath - I'd

(Judith Owen)

To taste a lover's lips again
To feel the sun beat on my face
To smell the sweetness of the air
To feel another's soft embrace

All the precious time I wasted
Half my life I threw away
Worrying about tomorrow
Wishing it was yesterday
