(Keeper)

This doesn't speak too well for the human race
I fear the entertainment's a disgrace
If all this pettiness is what life means
I'd rather live in this half-world of dreams
And never know a life up there above
With mortgages, relationships and love
And poverty, and pestilence and death
And yet these morons crave another breath
Well crave away, that's all behind you now
The Reaper has his hand upon the plough

And each day brings another human mob
And we poor servants grin and do our job
