(Keeper)

The parchment grows thin
So stretched is the skin
It's a wonder any man with eyes would have her
If it wasn't for the rouge
And the lipstick and the shoes
You might as well be kissing a cadaver

(Grympale, Malpensio)

And Death says. You can cheat me
For a while, but never beat me
Come one, come all
Come one, come all
