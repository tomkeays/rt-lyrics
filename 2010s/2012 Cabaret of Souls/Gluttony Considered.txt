(Keeper)

You should hear what they say about you behind your back

(Grympale, Malpensio)

Fat freak fat freak fat freak fat freak ooh

(Keeper)

Those friends of yours
When they shut their doors
Those maitre d's
Whose palms you grease
When their tongues are free of flattery and tact

(Fat freak fat freak fat freak fat freak ooh)

They loathe you
They loathe you
They loathe you
