I Really Do Love A Waltz
Written by Richard Thompson

(Keeper)

Ah! I really do love a waltz -
Da da dee dee da da da da da dee da
Don't you lads?

(Grympale, Malpensio)

Wa wa wa wa wa
Wa wa wa wa wa
O tears! O tears!
My little heart is broken
O tears! O tears!

(Keeper)

But this poor pathetic creature is too droopy
And her mental anguish nothing less than loopy
My brain and not my heart's the thing that melts
Pray drag her off and bring on someone else
