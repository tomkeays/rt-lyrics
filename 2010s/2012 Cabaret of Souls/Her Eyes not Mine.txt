Her Eyes Not Mine
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Cabaret of Souls 2012

Each little word
Each little sigh
So wonderful
To be loved
To be loved

That kiss should be mine
That glance should be mine
How can he be so blind
Her eyes not mine
Her lips not mine
Her taste not mine, not mine

If he could see me
See the heart that beats inside
No-one could give
More love than I
One day I'll make him see

Each little sigh
Each little word
I think of him
With her
That witches brew
That painted smile
That lying tongue
Her eyes not mine
Her eyes not mine
