(Keeper)

Get rid of them, Malpensio - get them out of my sight!
Maybe torture wasn't such a bad way to pass the time after allâ€¦
Fetch me my thumbscrews - where's that rack?
That little soprano could use a bit of stretching -

(Keeper, Grympale, Malpensio)

With poverty and pestilence and death

(Richard Thompson, Judith Owen)

Just one more breath, just one more breath
With poverty and pestilence and death
Just one more breath, just one more breath
With poverty and pestilence and death
Just one more breath, just one more -

(Ensemble)

Breath!
