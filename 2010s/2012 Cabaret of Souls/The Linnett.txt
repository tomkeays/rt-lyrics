The Linnett
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Cabaret of Souls 2012

Just leave me here by the river
I don't have strength to turn around
Too many times heartbreak has worn me down

Love is a ride that bucks and kicks you
Love is a dream, a world above
I've used up all my will in the name of love

I cared but he never cared about me
I ached but he never ached over me
I reached but he never reached out for me

Darling my heart is like a linnet
Flies like a bird home to its nest
Home to the one, the one it loves the best.

I cared but he never cared about me
I ached but he never ached over me
I reached but he never reached out for me

Darling my heart is like a linnet
Flies like a bird home to its nest
Home to the one, the one it loves the best.
