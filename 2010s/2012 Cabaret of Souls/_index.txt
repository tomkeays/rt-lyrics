Cabaret of Souls is an album released by Richard Thompson on 10 October 2012 on Beeswing Records. It was recorded at Bruce Ryan Soundstage at Idyllwild Arts Academy Idyllwild in May 2011. This album grew out of a small project that was planned for 2009 convention of the International Society of Bassists.
The society wished to honour Thompson's friend and frequent collaborator Danny Thompson, and commissioned Richard Thompson to write a piece to be performed at the convention and which would highlight Danny Thompson's skills. 

The theme is a "talent contest" in the afterlife between the souls of recently deceased people. Each soul sings a song revealing key elements of their lives, including a crucial sin or vanity. After each performance by a soul the Keeper Of Souls and his assistants sing or speak in reply.

After the initial performance at State College, Pennsylvania, the suite was performed intermittently in 2010 before Richard Thompson decided to record it in the studio in 2011. Danny Thompson was not available for these sessions, so David Piltch took the bass playing role.
