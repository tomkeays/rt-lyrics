Run Judas Run
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Cabaret of Souls 2012

You don't even know how you ruined my life, do you?
You just don't get it, you just don't sweat it, do you?
You wrote those words so perfectly
As if you saw right into me
You saw my part in the human farce
As if my soul was made of glass

(As if his soul was made of glass
As if his soul was made of glass)

But then one day the stories changed, didn't they?
The words now came out cold and strange, didn't they?
Was it greed that made you swerve
Lose your touch or lose your nerve
Now your style is flat and samey
O Judas, you did betray me

(O Judas you did betray me
O Judas you did betray me)

Run, Judas, Run Judas, Run, Judas, Run
Run, Judas, Run Judas, Run, Judas, Run
You did it all so cleverly
You looked inside the soul of me
You looked inside the soul of every
Lonely lonely lonely lonely boy
Lonely boy

And you talked to that girl at the fan magazine, didn't you?
You fudged a bit and you dodged a bit, didn't you?
You said your life was in those songs
The ups and downs, the rights and wrongs
But you and I, we know better
That's my life down to the letter

(That's his life, down to the letter)

And that wife of yours, she saw the light
She knew you were too chicken for a fight
Hit you with the toaster, had to wire your jaw
Now you're sucking your refreshment down through a straw

(Sucking your refreshment down through a straw
Sucking your refreshment down through a straw
Sucking your refreshment down through a straw)

And if one of your trollops scratches your eyes out - goody
Or some jealous husband gets his spies out - goody
But how I miss those sensitive tales
A lonely bedsit, a beach in Wales
My tortured poet's a fornicator
But you'll get yours sooner or later

(You'll get yours sooner or later
You'll get yours sooner or later)

Run, Judas, Run Judas, Run, Judas, Run
Run, Judas, Run Judas, Run, Judas, Run
You did it all so cleverly
You looked inside the soul of me
You looked inside the soul of every
Lonely lonely lonely lonely boy
Lonely boy
