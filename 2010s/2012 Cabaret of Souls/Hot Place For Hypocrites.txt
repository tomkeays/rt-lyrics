There's a hot place for hypocrites a
There's a hot place for hypocrites a
There's a hot place for hypocrites it
Really warms your toes
And you'll be so cosy there, and
And you'll be so cosy there, and
And you'll be so cosy there, you
Won't need any clothes

Till your skin bubbles off and your bones poke through
They'll use you for ashtrays, they'll use you for glue

There's a hot place for hypocrites a
There's a hot place for hypocrites and
I wouldn't want to be a hypocrite like you
