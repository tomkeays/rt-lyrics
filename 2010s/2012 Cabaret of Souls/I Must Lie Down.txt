I Must Lie Down
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Cabaret of Souls 2012

I am so jolly, so very very jolly
What a very jolly man I am
I'm known to every Maitre d'
As the happiest man you'll ever see
I pity those slight of appetite
For since my days in a pram
I have so very contentedly fed
On things much larger than my head
Do you know me? Do you know me?
What a happy man I am!

But I must lie down
Yes I must lie down
I am a little short of breath
That treacle tart will be my death
And I must lie down
Yes I must lie down
But if I do, friends, haul me up
'Cause I love to dine, or sip, or sup
And it's nearly time to start all over

I can never say no to a fine Bordeaux
Or a sole from the Straits Of Dover
2 dozen oysters on the shell
A mutton pie and mash as well
If I might procure a soup du jour
I'm happy as a pig in clover
And speaking of pigs, I'll have him en croute
Or spit-roasted in his birthday suit
Wash it all down with an ale of renown
Then it's time to start all over

But I must lie down
Yes I must lie down
I think I might have overdone
The Steak Diane and the old Blue Nun
But I must lie down
Yes I must lie down
But if I do just dust me off
And sit me down at the nearest trough
'Cause it's nearly time to start all over!

I love to start out a la carte
A page at a time will do
Pile those appetizers high
Spleen of lamprey, bullock's eye
And crayfish nine or ten at a time
And a mulligatawny stew
Followed by venison, lightly braised
Aspic of pigeon, lightly glazed
Good health sir? Thank you sir!
And I wish the same to you

But I must lie down
Yes I must lie down
About my girth I have no guilt
I feel I'm comfortably built
But I must confess
That my health's a mess
But I'll eat till my blood congeal
'Cause I can't stand to miss a meal
And it's nearly time to start all over.
