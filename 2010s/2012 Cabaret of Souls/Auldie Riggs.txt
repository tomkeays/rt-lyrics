Auldie Riggs

My name is Auldie Riggs and I am a seaman, second rate
I'll tell you quite a tale if you've got the price of a drink there, mate
Do you recognize my face? The picture ran for a week or more
When I left her lifeless body on the floor.

I am a drunken sot, they threw me off a dozen crews
My brain's begun to rot, I'm so beholden to the booze
And I broke that Liza's neck, well I squeezed her till she breathed no more
And I left her lifeless body on the floor.

And I don't feel no sympathy
And your disgust to me's the highest praise
She had it coming, don't you know?
'Cause I got wise to all her little ways.

Whores and bitches, all are Riggs'es slaves.

There's many I've dispatched, now tell me, was it 8 or 9?
I throttled 'em, I stabbed 'em, dissolved 'em in a vat of lime
I used to know the names but Liza was the last, the whore
And I left her lifeless body on the floor.

And you won't get no remorse from me
I'm happy as a kitten with the cream
I did her and the others too
I dare to do what some men only dream.

How I love to hear that piercing scream.

That Mary was a tramp, oh she used to give the boys a wink
I took some souvenirs before I drowned her in the sink
I kept her cheating heart and her pretty eyes which I did adore
And left her lifeless body on the floor
I left her lifeless body on the floor
I left her lifeless body, her dirty cheating body
I left her lifeless body on the floor.
