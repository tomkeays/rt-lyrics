My Dave
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Cabaret of Souls 2012

Why don't they trust my Dave
Well he has had the odd close shave
He did time in The Scrubs
For the lease on his pubs
But they all long since forgave

I've always liked the kind of man
Who does all the charm and romance
And Dave was always sending cards and flowers round
He had a few unsavoury friends, I grant you
Hearts of gold, though, really
I could have had my pick but Dave was more my style
Diamonds and the odd fur coat once in a while
He ruled with an iron fist, you have to, don't you?

But like all hard men, he'd a sensitive side
On a ballroom floor he loved to glide
We'd leave behind the hurly-burly
And leg it to The Orchid, Purley

And how we danced
Into the night
Under the stars
Of the disco light
How we danced
So tenderly
All eyes on him
All eyes on me

I've always liked the kind of man
Who does all the charm and romance
And Dave was always sending cards and flowers round

So why don't they like my Dave?
Just 'cause he's got heavy friends?
A few heads get cracked
A few people get whacked
But it's all for the best in the end
