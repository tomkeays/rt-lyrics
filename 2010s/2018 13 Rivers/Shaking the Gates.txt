Shaking the Gates

If angels are real, then who needs dreams?
I think I'll never close my eyes again
If my feet betray me, lock the door
My heart may never be this wise again

I'm shaking
I'm shaking
I'm shaking the Gates of Heaven

I used to hold the world, it turned to gold
Now everything that moved me has grown cold

If life is for living, I'm your man
Never was inclined to pine away
If echoes and shadows are my world
All I've done is lead myself astray

I'm shaking
I'm shaking
I'm shaking the Gates of Heaven

If angels are real, then who needs dreams?
I think I'll never close my eyes again

I'm shaking
I'm shaking
I'm shaking the Gates of Heaven

I'm shaking
I'm shaking
I'm shaking the Gates of Heaven
