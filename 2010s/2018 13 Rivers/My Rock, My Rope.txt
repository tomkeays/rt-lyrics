My Rock, My Rope
Written by Richard Thompson

In my pain, in my darkness
Is my comfort and hope
In my loss and in my sorrow
Is my rock, is my rope

Give me the strength to bear it
Give me the strength to see
That this is not forever
But what must be, must be

In my cloud of illusion
Give me some way I can steer
Through the shores and the shipwrecks
'Til I see my way is clear

Let me uplift it
Or take this away from me
And heal me from my demons
And forever I'll be free

In my pain, in my darkness
Is my comfort and (?)
In my loss and in my sorrow
Is my rock, my rope
Is my rock, my rope
Is my rock, is my rope
