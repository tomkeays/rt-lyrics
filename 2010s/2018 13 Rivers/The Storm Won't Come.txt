The Storm Won't Come

I'm longing for a storm to blow through town
And blow these sad old buildings down
Fire to burn what fire might
And rain to wash it all away

But the storm won't come
But the storm won't come
I'm longing for the storm
But the storm won't come

There's a smell of death where I lay my head
So I'll go to the storm instead
I'll seek it out and stand in the rain
Thunder and lightning, and I'll scream my name

But it's never the same
But it's never the same
The storm must come to me
And the storm won't come

But a leaf is stuck, the dust is blowing
There is no storm so I'll make my own
Paint up the walls and I'll buy what's rotten
Throw out all the old and the half-forgotten

But I'm not as strong
But I'm not as strong
As the wind and the rain
And the storm won't come

But the storm won't come
The storm won't come
I'm longing for the storm
But the storm won't come
