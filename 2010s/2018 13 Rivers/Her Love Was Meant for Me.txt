Her Love Was Meant for Me

Gypsy finger traced my loveline
She's my soul and destiny
Three times I turned the queen of hearts
Her love was meant for me

Cupid shoots just like a baby
Now Romeo won't let her be
Shoot them darts in my direction
Her love was meant for me

As a kid I saw rainbows
But life, it turns you upside down
It shakes the money out of your wranglers
Leaves you heaving on the ground

Oh I followed all the prophecies
From sea to shining sea
She came to me walking backwards
Her love was meant for me

Now she's mine I plan to keep her
So put your eyes back in their sockets
Keep your paws off the upholstery
Put your hands back in your pockets

Oh she doesn't look at you, brother
The way she looks at me
Like a laser through a scarecrow
Her love was meant for me

Don't need a ticket for the future
The apocalypse is free
Armageddon's in the mirror
And her love was meant for me

And her love was meant for me
