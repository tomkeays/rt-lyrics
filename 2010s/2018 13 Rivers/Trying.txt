Trying

What kind of breeze do you think you are?
You bend me 'til I break
And what kind of dance did you drag me to?
Like a Baptist, I moan and shake

If I should fall, fall off the shelf
I'm only trying to be true to myself
To be true

I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
Well, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I–

I thought I could fake forever
But I was wrong
I thought I could wait forever
I thought I was strong
Can't put on the brake forever
Forever's too long
You shake me 'til I don't know right from–
Right from wrong

And what kind of house are you building for me?
The sand shifts under my feet
And what kind of pill did you slip in my tea?
The bitter tastes so sweet

If I should fall, fall off the shelf
I'm only trying to be true to myself
To be true

I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
Well, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I–

I thought I could fake forever
But I was wrong
I thought I could wait forever
I thought I was strong
Can't put on the brake forever
Forever's too long
You shake me 'til I don't know right from–
Right from wrong
Right from wrong
Right from wrong
