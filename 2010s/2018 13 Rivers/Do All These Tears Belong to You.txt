Do All These Tears Belong to You?

Holdin', lovin', sharin', kissin'
Hauntin', hurtin', tearin', missing
Losing love and losing love again

Fakin', fakin', sometimes break
Searchin', longin', hiding', wonderin'
Somewhere there's a face, and there's a name

We could end it right away
We could wish our lives away
We could twist the night away
Oh, could look into a (?)
Pretend it's all just a dream
But I've never seen two eyes so green
Or seen a pair so black and blue
Do all these tears belong to you?

Wishin', dreamin', bumpin', schemin'
Longin', yearnin', never turnin'
Somewhere, out there, there's a part of you
Fightin', knowin', laughin', rollin', weepin'
Spilling tears (?) the pieces of the drinking

We could end it right away
We could wish our lives away
We could twist the night away
Oh, could look into a (?)
Pretend it's all just a dream
Oh, I've never seen two eyes so green
Or seen a pair so black and blue
Do all these tears belong to you?
Do all these tears belong to you?
