Family was conceived by Teddy Thompson when, after he lost his recording contract with Verve Records and came to the end of a serious relationship, he approached his musical family members to contribute to an all-Thompson album. Teddy Thompson states: "I had some kind of mid-life crisis early and was having a real hard time with personal stuff...so I decided to make this record", stating further that "family is really important, and I've missed them".

The various musicians contributed a song or two each as well as playing on each other's material. According to Richard Thompson, the contributions took "two to three years" to compile, with everyone writing their own material and sending files to each other. The album was then worked on throughout 2013 by Teddy Thompson and completed with studio sessions in London and New York afterwards with all the participating family members in attendance.
