One Life At A Time
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Family 2014

One life at a time
One life at a time
If you're busy living yours
You won't be living mine
One life at a time
One life at a time
That ugly noise you're making
Sounds just like a whine

Sometimes you need a brother
Sometimes you help one another
I'm afraid that my brother
Might turn out to be you
Sometimes it's hard to say
What you got to say anyway
I'm going to have to say
That I'm not thrilled about you

One life at a time
One life at a time
You're building me a prison
Where breathing is a crime
One life at a time
One life at a time
I won't be Cinderella
In your psycho pantomime

Sometimes you need a brother
Sometimes you help one another
I'm afraid that my brother
Might turn out to be you
Sometimes it's hard to say
What you got to say anyway
I'm going to have to say
That I'm not thrilled about you
