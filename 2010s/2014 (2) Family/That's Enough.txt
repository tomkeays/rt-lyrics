Thatâ€™s Enough

We still keep falling for the same old lies
We still keep falling for the same old lies
We still keep falling for the same old lies
Times are tough, times are tough
That's enough (that's enough)

They're still throwing fairy dust into our eyes
They're still throwing fairy dust into our eyes
They're still throwing fairy dust into our eyes
Times are tough, times are tough
That's enough (that's enough)

Can't get a job, can't pay the rent
Can't feed ourselves, money's all been spent
It's pie in the sky and the same old lie
Come round again, round again, round again

They still keep spinning those old alibis
They still keep spinning those old alibis
They still keep spinning those old alibis
Times are tough, times are tough
That's enough (that's enough)

Better not make a scene, better not make a fuss
'Cos there's one of you to ninety-nine of us
With a little slight of hand, change the laws of the land
Screwed again, screwed again, screwed again

They're still throwing fairy dust into our eyes
They're still throwing fairy dust into our eyes
They're still throwing fairy dust into our eyes
Times are tough, times are tough
That's enough (that's enough)
