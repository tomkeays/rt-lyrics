The Doc in You
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on 13 Rivers 2018

It's not love that you're looking for
It's not love that you're hunting down
You're just on the trail
Of the innocent, the frail
And you're gonna rob them

You don't mind causing pain
Or who you drive insane
And those time-bombs explode
Years down the road
But that's not your problem

All that pain
Again and again
To put a twinkle in your eye
All that grief
To give you some relief
And to satisfy
The dog in you

Please don't say "that's the way God made me"
Please don't say "I can't help who I am"
You can't justify, you're beyond any measure
Just to get your pleasure

All that pain
Again and again
To put that twinkle in your eye
All that grief
Just to give you some relief
And to satisfy
The dog in you
The dog in you
The dog in you
