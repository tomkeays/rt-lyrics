You Can't Reach Me

I can reach you but you can't reach me
Not a damn thing that you can teach me
I get my education direct
Direct from up above

I take on board the bits that fit
The war and Armageddon and shit
I ditch all the mercy and kindness
All kindness and peace and love

You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold

The way I see it, the world's not fair
I don't fit here and I don't fit there
I was born not belonging to one thing
To one thing or the other

But I found a rock that I can cling to
I found a flock that I can sing to
A corner of the world and here they call me
Here they call me "brother"

You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold

Don't give me that innocent stuff
Don't give me that line
There's guilt in everything that you do
You're guilty all of the time

You think I'm one of you but I've got things cooking
I hide in the open right where you're looking
You know what I come here for
And I'm knocking on your door

You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold
