No Matter

No matter what you say, I'll believe
I don't see an ace up your sleeve
Can't you see me smile
Just the shadow of a frown?
Even if wanting you will tear my mansion down

No matter what you say, my head's in the sink
Born yesterday? I don't think
I've seen it all before
Love letters burned
Contemplating suicide before the tide had turned

And I can't leave my life like Shakespeare on the run
Some lines are easy, the soliloquies won't come

I'm living on fantasy
Real life's too good for me
Let me disappear from here
And be no one

No matter what you say, do you need me?
Doesn't mean you'll stay, doesn't mean that you'll leave
'Cause everybody bleeds
And everybody cries
Now it's time for bandages and rags to dry our eyes

I'm living on fantasy
Real life's too good for me
Let me disappear from here
And be no one

No matter what you say, I'll believe
I'll believe
I'll believe
I'll believe
I'll believe
