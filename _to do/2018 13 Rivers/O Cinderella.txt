O Cinderella

I've been drifting along with a skeleton crew
Two-Gun O'Grady and Blackjack and Willie Mulgrew
But I run into trouble the day that I run into you

I thought you was looking for money stuffed under the bed
(O Cinderella, o Cinderella)
You were talking to the mirror, I thought you was gone in the head
(O Cinderella, o Cinderella)
But you were just saying Hail Marys to comfort the dead
(O Cinderella, o Cinderella)

O Cinderella, your rags are so chic
Do they come off the peg at your favorite boutique?
Could you please spare the time to run an old tar up the creek?
Well I hope that you're listening, I'm stating my case
I'll say it again till I'm blue in the face
O Cinderella, I'm not very house-trained, it's true
But I want to make cupcakes with you

O Cinderella, you run like I'm Jack the Ripper
(O Cinderella, o Cinderella)
Won't you trade up your rags and slide your foot in this slipper?
(O Cinderella, o Cinderella)
You're working-class cool, but a glass slipper is hipper
(O Cinderella, o Cinderella)

O Cinderella, your rags are so chic
Do they come off the peg at your favorite boutique?
Could you please spare the time to run an old tar up the creek?
Well I hope that you're listening, I'm stating my case
I'll say it again till I'm blue in the face
O Cinderella, I'm not very house-trained, it's true
But I want to dust cobwebs with you
Cobwebs with you
(O Cinderella)
I want to dust cobwebs with you
(O Cinderella)
(O Cinderella)
(O Cinderella)
