Bones of Gilead

What's my name? My name is Trouble
Trouble of the tender kind
From the ruin, from the rubble
I will rise like London pride

No checkpoint will stop me
There is no plan
Like an earthquake, I'll rock you
Run if you can

By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead

What's my name? My name is Heartbreak
Heartbreak of the giving kind
I will come and whisper sweetness
Sweetness that will dawn your mind

No ribcage can hold me
No loving cup
I don't fit your wise world
I tear it up

By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead

What's my name? Just call me Micah
Micah like the Bible says
I can't help it, it's within me
Runes are written on my face

False prophets accuse me
Their days are few
I heal all before me
I will heal you

By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
