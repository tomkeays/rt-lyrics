Oh, holy man save you from the dance with the Devil
Jesus save you from that bottle of gin
Voodoo save you from a sleepwalk woman
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?

Well, that voice might come when you're taking your pleasure
That voice might come when you're resting your bones
It'll seek you out when you're sad or smiling
It'll track you down when you think you're alone

Just when you think that your horses are running
Just when you think that you're fixing to win
There's that wondering deep inside you
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?
Save me, save me, save me
From the rattle within

He wears your shirt and he wears your shoes
He's living right there inside your skin
You've got notions, and he's got notions
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?

Well, a man's made of muscle and he's gonna wrestle
But when he gets weary, he ain't gonna win
Who's gonna save you when the tank is empty?
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?

Ah, just when you think that your horse is running
Just when you think that you're fixing to win
There's that wondering deep inside you
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?
Save me, save me, save me
From the rattle within

Well, holy man save you from the dance with the Devil
Jesus save you from that bottle of gin
Voodoo save you from a sleepwalk woman
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?
