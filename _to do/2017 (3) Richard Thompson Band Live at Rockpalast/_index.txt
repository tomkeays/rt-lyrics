In 1983, Thompson went on tour to promote his album, "Hand Of Kindness." For the show on December 12, 1983, at the Hamburg Markthalle the WDR also put up their cameras to record the event for the Rockpalast. The studio crew from the recording sessions of "Hand Of Kindness" was also present live. Among them three musicians who stood on stage with Thompson with Fairport Convention more than ten years before: Simon Nicol, Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks. 

Nearly seven weeks later, on January 26, 1984 Richard Thompson & Band gave another concert in the French luxury resort Cannes on occasion of MIDEM being recorded by the WDR as well. Gerry Conway, today the drummer with the still active folk rock institution Fairport Convention, replaced Dave Mattacks, Rory McFarlane (bass) came for Dave Pegg who had to go into the studio to record a new album with his band Jethro Tull. 

In both concerts it is to be heard how well the musicians know each other and how they have been harmonizing for years. They are building an integrated whole with Richard Thompson. They carry the music of their "boss" and give him the lightness and the leeway to fully unfold his potential. Both concerts are an absolute must for every Thompson fan.
