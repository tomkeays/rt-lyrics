Hand Of Kindness (new lyrics 2020) 
Richard Thompson

I was living it fast
I was living it loose
Next thing I know
My neck’s in the noose
O stranger, stranger
It’s nearly that time
You stretch out your hand
I stretch out mine

Maybe just the hand of kindness
Maybe just the hand of kindness
Maybe just the hand
Stranger will you reach me in time?

If I’d just paid attention
I’d seen it for sure
Six in the morning
That knock on the door
And they called me a Jonah
It’s a sin I survived
You stretch out your hand
I stretch out mine

Maybe just the hand of kindness
Maybe just the hand of kindness
Maybe just the hand
Stranger will you reach me in time?

Shoot that old horse
He’s gone in the knees
While you’re about it
Save one for me.
If I’d just paid attention
I’d have heard the dogs whine
You stretch out your hand
I stretch out mine
