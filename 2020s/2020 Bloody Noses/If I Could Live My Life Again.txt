If I Could Live My Life Again
Richard Thompson
Bloody Noses (2020)

Well, you know, I can't do nothing for you
And you know, I say my piece and then
I pound the pavement always wishing
Whether I would live my life again

Will I raise some Cain and sink some whiskey
Or ramble like I'm anything
There's arms I've held and hearts I've broken
Oh if I could live my life again

Oh I hate the four walls of this prison
Those cowards let me take the blame
Next time I'll run with better company
Oh if I could live my life again

And you know, true love slipped through my fingers
Somehow, I never could explain
Next time, I'll say just what I'm thinking
Oh if I could live my life again

I wish my sins could be forgiven
And that's why I sing this sad refrain
Just one more chance is all I'm asking
Oh if I could live my life again
Oh if I could live my life again
