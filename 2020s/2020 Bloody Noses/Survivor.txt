Survivor
Richard Thompson
Bloody Noses (2020)

Oh you've been through some battles
I can see by the pain in your eyes
As you look off into the distance
That far away sign

They could have destroyed you
But somehow you came through it all
Beat up, combusted
But better from learning to fall

So here's to another survivor
Your troubles are distant like me
I've been waiting my whole life to love you
I'll treat you as fine as can be

There's a lot to come knocking
Is that why you're looking at all
You're tired of the bullshit
You can't take the lies anymore

It's there on their faces
The words don't impress you so much
You spent your life half as a doormat
Half as a crutch

So here's to another survivor
Your troubles are distant like me
I've been waiting my whole life to love you
I'll treat you as fine as can be

Now let's lean on each other
It's quicker to get down the road
We both are less likely to stumble
By sharing the load

And here's to another survivor
Your troubles are distant like me
I've been waiting my whole life to love you
And I'll treat you as fine as can be
And I'll treat you as fine as can be
