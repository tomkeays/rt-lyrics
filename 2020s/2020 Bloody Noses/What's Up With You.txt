What’s Up With You?
Richard Thompson
Bloody Noses (2020)

What's up with you?
What are you trying to tell me?
That you've got no love to give me?
Now you're going to leave for someone new!

What's up with you?
Did it all get too much for you?
To have someone adore you
In some strange way I knew
What's up with you!

If you go your way, I'll go mine
We'll disentwine
Love's so unkind
That way

Well I don't get you
Seems I never knew you
Love just goes right through you
Like it surges ballyhoo
What's up with you?

What's up with you?
Later, alligator
To a bad communicator
Who could never spit out the news
What's up with you?

I wish you nothing but good luck
Hope you break your duck
As you run amuck
Out there

What's up with you?
Does it all have to be a secret?
You'd do anything to keep it
Though you're beaten black and blue
What's up with you?
What's up with you?
What's up with you?
