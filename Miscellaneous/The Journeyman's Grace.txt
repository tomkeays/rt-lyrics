The Journeyman’s Grace
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Fairport Convention on Angel Delight (1971)

Someone told me there’s a grace
That leads you straight from place to place
And you always leave the road behind you
You don’t need your horses shod
Just a dowser and his rod
Leave your mistress, she won’t need to find you

Oh please journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won’t be afraid
Oh please journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won’t be afraid

Lead my weary flesh and bone
To a circle made of stone
Take me to the mountains for my pleasure
And if the dead man won’t depart
Drive a stake into his heart
And let the air deliver him his measure

Oh please journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won’t be afraid
Oh please journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won’t be afraid

When you see your race is run
And the dark has just begun
Come on with the few and leave the many
There you’ll find the journeyman
With a lantern in his hand
He’ll show you a good time for a penny

Oh please journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won’t be afraid
Oh please journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won’t be afraid
