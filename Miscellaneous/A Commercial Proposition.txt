A Commercial Proposition
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Matthews’ Southern Comfort (1970)

Alright, everything’s alright
Everything’s alright now
You don’t have a trouble
And you don’t have a care
Alright

Alright, everything’s alright
Everything’s alright now
So bring in the fiddle
You left out on the stair
Alright, Alright

Don’t you worry ‘bout a thing
As you fly upon the wing
Everybody knows
You just had to dance and sing

Alright, everything’s alright
Everything’s alright now
You don’t have a trouble
And you don’t have a care
Alright, alright, alright

Don’t you worry ‘bout a thing
As you fly upon the wing
‘Cause everybody knows
You just had to dance and sing

Alright, everything’s alright
Everything’s alright now
You don’t have a trouble
And you don’t have a care
Alright, Alright, Alright
