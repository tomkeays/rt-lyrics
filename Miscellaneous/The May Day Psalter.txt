The May Day Psalter
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Circle Dance (various artists) (1990)

Give me simple for my pleasure
Charity for my success
Give me wisdom and misfortune
Heart’s ease for my distress

When men boast or make me tremble
When men mock or make me weak
Give me veils to cover over
Secrets that my heart may keep

Sharpen up my axe to shatter
King, tyrant, fool, or fake
Let me love to overflowing
Flooding ‘till my banks do break

Wash me like a rock in a river
Cover up my tracks with rain
Move me like a wave on the ocean
Risen once never rise again

The May Day Psalter (written by Richard Thompson) [as recorded by Richard Thompson on Circle Dance (various artists) (1990)]
