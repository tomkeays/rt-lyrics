Don't Tell Secrets
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on German copies of Daring Adventures in 1986

Don’t tell secrets
Don’t tell secrets
Don’t tell why we hide
In the dim lights and the wine
And your secret is buried next to mine

In the midst of strangers
In the midst of strangers
We dance, embrace and bind our promises
While the singer makes our hearts break one more time

Oh you’re in this shantytown
Of tin and tumble-down
But a man might be or a man might lack
A weight arises on his back
And our love the shame of all your hands possess
Oh you sewed a hundred patches on your dress

But don’t tell secrets
Don’t tell secrets
Raise your eyes to mine
As the bell rings closing time
And your secret is buried next to mine

Oh darling how we cheat
To make the moment sweet
Outside this room the world still waits
You with your mansion with gilded gates
And me with my companies and regiments
I wear you like a stone upon my chest

So don’t tell secrets
Don’t tell secrets
Don’t tell why we hide
In the dim lights and the wine
And your secret is buried next to mine

Don’t tell secrets
Don’t tell secrets

Don't Tell Secrets (written by Richard Thompson) [as recorded by Richard Thompson on the Polydor promotional live single, recorded 1985 and released in German copies of Daring Adventures in 1986]
