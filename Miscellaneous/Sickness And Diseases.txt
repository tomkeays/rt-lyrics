Sickness And Diseases
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Angel Delight (1971)

I do hate to see a rover riddled in the stones
Now he’s one step nearer to the ground
And I do hate to see a hawker
Broken in the bones

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

Everybody’s got the sickness, everybody’s down
Running to the doctor with a pound
Doctor, doctor, do you have a needle
Big enough for me

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

My friend Willy—well he looks so ill
His face as white as milk
Everybody runs for miles when he’s in town
He’s got every known disease
And some without a name

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

If you want to live to be
A poor man or a prince
Pay good attention when
Evil times abound
Always listen to what your mother said
And stay in bed at night

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

Sickness And Diseases (written by Dave Swarbrick/Richard Thompson) [as recorded by Fairport Convention on Angel Delight (1971)]
