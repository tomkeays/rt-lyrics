It Don’t Cost Much
Written by Richard Thompson and Marvin Etzioni
Appears on The World Is A Wonderful Place (various artists) (1993)

It don’t cost much to let me go
But if it does, I’ll pay the price
It don’t cost much to call me u
If you can’t look me in the eye

It don’t cost much
It don’t cost much
And no matter how much you give
It don’t cost much

It don’t cost much to hear my heart
But I can tell you never will
It don’t cost much to break apart
What took years to build
 
It don’t cost much
It don’t cost much
And no matter how much you give
It don’t cost much
 
If someone stays and someone leaves
You know I would rather be the leaver
I’ll take the pain of being deceived
For all the guilt of the deceiver

It don’t cost much
It don’t cost much
And no matter how much you give
It don’t cost much
It don’t cost much
And no matter how much you give
It don’t cost much

It don’t cost much
It don’t cost much
It don’t cost much
It don’t cost much
It don’t cost much
