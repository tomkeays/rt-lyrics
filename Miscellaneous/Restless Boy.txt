Restless Boy
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Give Me A Sad Song (2001)

Michael listen to me
I’m old, I’ve seen life come and go
And I can tell you what I know
Hear me out and then I’ll let you be

My son, I know your mind
I see you still like a little boy
You’re always after some new toy
You’re never pleased with what you find

Hungry restless boy
Born with the restless way
You will find your happy dream someday

You think the pearly gates
Will swing wide open just for you
See all the work you have to do
Until you’re ready, can’t you wait

Hungry restless boy
Born with the restless way
You will find your happy dream someday

See how you run
You won’t take from your father’s hand
You turn your back on the promised land
Do you still call yourself a son

The people that you try to be
You think you’re different, you change your name
I can see through you, you’re just the same
You still look like a Jew to me

Hungry restless boy
Born with the restless way
You will find your happy dream someday

On a cold day you were born
The wind took breath as your breath did start
The wind still lives inside your heart
Blowing up strong like a storm

Restless Boy (written by Richard Thompson) [as recorded by Richard and Linda Thompson in 1973 and issued on the Linda Thompson c.d. Give Me A Sad Song]
