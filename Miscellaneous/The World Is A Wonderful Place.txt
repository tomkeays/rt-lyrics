The World Is A Wonderful Place
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Give Me A Sad Song (2001)

Lovers pair off and they fall into bed
The same old lies trip off the tongue
A few lonely hearts stand and prop up the room
The night is young

Envy the bodies asleep on the floor
Dreaming some comfortable dream
And envy the drunk as he falls through the door
For the world is drunk I see

You live and you die
There’s no reason why
The world is a wonderful place

The poor live in pain
They’re sick and insane
Oh the world is a wonderful place

How does it feel to be nothing?
How does it feel to be small?
Pour hard on that wine
It’s the end of the line
Oh the world is a wonderful place

Another year older and nothing to show
Is this what I grew up to be?
How are you birthday boy?
Here’s a pat on the back
You’re a sight to see

Am I just a clown
Like the fools gathered here?
Am I nothing special at all?

If this is called living
I’m folding my hand
I’m sick of the same brick wall

You live and you die
There’s no reason why
The world is a wonderful place

The poor live in pain
They’re sick and insane
Oh the world is a wonderful place

How does it feel to be nothing?
How does it feel to be small?
Pour hard on that wine
It’s the end of the line
Oh the world is a wonderful place
