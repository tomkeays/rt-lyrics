Rainbow Over The Hill
Written by Richard Thompson
Appears on Rise Up Like The Sun (1978)

Rainbow over the hill
Rainbow over the hill
Rain clouds lifting
Just when you think they never will

And I’ll be on my way
Up and down in a swamp all day
And just when it broke my will
There’s a rainbow over the hill

Don’t you worry your weary head
About the fools and problems in your way
If you could see beyond tomorrow
You never would shed a tear today

Rainbow over the hill
Rainbow over the hill
New day breaking
No time to be standing still

And further on down the road
I’ll reap what I have sown
And just when I’ve had my fill
There’s a rainbow over the hill

Don’t you worry your weary head
About the fools and problems in your way
If you could see beyond tomorrow
You never would shed a tear today

Rainbow over the hill
Rainbow over the hill
Rain clouds lifting
Just when you think they never will

And I’ll be on my way
Up and down in the swamp all day
And just when I’ve had my fill
There’s a rainbow over the hill
Rainbow over the hill
Rainbow over the hill
